2024-02-06,"Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board Sydney â 5Â and 6Â February 2024 Members present MicheleÂ Bullock (Governor and Chair), IanÂ HarperÂ AO, CarolynÂ HewsonÂ AO, StevenÂ KennedyÂ PSM, IainÂ RossÂ AO, ElanaÂ RubinÂ AM, CarolÂ SchwartzÂ AO, AlisonÂ WatkinsÂ AM Others present ChristopherÂ Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), MarionÂ Kohler (Head, Economic Analysis Department), TomÂ Rosewall (Deputy Head, Economic Analysis Department) AnthonyÂ Dickman (Secretary), DavidÂ Norman (Deputy Secretary) SarahÂ Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), PenelopeÂ Smith (Head, International Department), CarlÂ Schwartz (Acting Head, Domestic Markets Department), MeredithÂ Beechey Osterholm (Future Hub), SallyÂ Cray (Chief Communications Officer) International economic developments Members began by observing that global inflation remained high but that there had been encouraging progress in reducing inflation towards central banksÂ targets. Much of the easing in inflation in advanced economies had been due to movements in energy and goods prices. Members noted that global shipping costs had increased recently, partly related to attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. While this posed some upside risk to tradable goods inflation, the increases in shipping costs had been small relative to those seen during the pandemic. Compared with goods price inflation, core services price inflation had continued to ease only gradually in most advanced economies. Rent inflation was yet to show clear signs of easing in many economies. On the other hand, inflation for services other than housing had eased from its peaks, consistent with the gradual easing in labour market conditions and an improvement in the balance of demand and supply for services. However, overall services price inflation remained high relative to pre-pandemic rates. Economic growth had slowed to below-trend rates in many advanced economies in response to restrictive monetary policy settings. This had contributed to progress in returning inflation to target. Members noted that real household disposable income growth was positive in a number of advanced economies, yet consumption growth remained subdued. The United States was the main exception, with relatively firm growth in real incomes and consumption underpinning robust economic growth. GDP growth in AustraliaÂs major trading partners was expected to ease in 2024. Growth in China was expected to slow over 2024 and 2025 as the post-pandemic rebound in consumption of services fades and the property sector remains weak. Weakness in these areas was expected to be partly offset by continued strength in manufacturing investment and further policy support for infrastructure investment. Additional policy measures had supported Chinese steel production and, in turn, the prices of iron ore and coking coal received by Australian exporters. Domestic economic conditions Members observed that inflation in Australia had moderated, with both headline and underlying inflation lower in the December quarter 2023 than had been expected three months prior. Core goods price inflation had declined faster than expected, as also seen abroad. Services price inflation, which largely reflects conditions in the domestic economy, had declined to a lesser extent and remained high. Members discussed how much signal to take from the faster-than-expected decline in inflation in the December quarter and whether goods price inflation might fall further given ongoing excess capacity in the Chinese economy. They also considered the implications for inflation if various subsidies that were due to expire were extended. Members discussed how high inflation, higher taxes and tighter monetary policy had contributed to a noticeable slowing in growth in aggregate demand over 2023. Looking through the volatility in monthly outcomes, retail sales volumes were expected to have been broadly unchanged in the December quarter. Retailers had reported that similar conditions had persisted into the first part of 2024. More broadly, weak household spending growth, particularly in per capita terms, had been only partly offset by strong growth in business investment and public demand. Labour market conditions had remained tight but had continued to ease over preceding months in response to slower economic growth. The unemployment rate and underemployment rate had both increased by around Â½Â percentage point since mid-2023, albeit from low levels. Overall, conditions in the labour market were assessed to be tight relative to what would be consistent with sustained full employment. Wages growth had remained robust, although there were signs that it was slowing in some segments of the labour market. Very weak productivity outcomes over the preceding years had contributed to a sharp increase in labour costs per unit of output. Members acknowledged that it is too soon to determine the extent to which a fading of the lingering disruptions from the pandemic and the adoption of artificial intelligence would support a turnaround in productivity growth. Members also discussed the staffÂs assessment of spare capacity in the economy. Estimates of potential output, while subject to significant uncertainty, suggested that the level of aggregate demand remained above the economyÂs supply capacity. This was also consistent with other indicators of spare capacity, such as survey measures of utilisation, metrics from the labour market and the rate of inflation. Turning to the outlook, members noted that overall demand growth was expected to remain subdued in the near term as high inflation and earlier interest rate increases continue to weigh on household consumption. The near-term outlook for GDP growth had been revised down modestly from the outlook three months prior. This mainly reflected a weaker outlook for consumer spending, reflecting the decline in real incomes over recent years. As inflation moderates and real incomes start to rise from 2024, consumption growth was expected to recover gradually to its pre-pandemic average over 2025. Members considered the risk that consumers might not increase spending as real incomes begin to rise again; this could occur if the effect of the previous fall in real wages outweighs the support from the large stock of additional savings built up in 2020 and 2021 as well as the rise in housing wealth over the previous year. They concluded that the outlook for consumption remains a significant source of uncertainty, with risks to the upside and downside. Members also discussed the implications of the announced changes to the Stage 3Â income tax cuts. They noted that the aggregate reduction in income tax payable was similar to the legislated Stage 3Â tax cuts already incorporated in the staffÂs forecasts. Members were briefed on the potential for the different distribution of income tax reductions across households to affect the forecasts and concluded that the effect would be negligible for plausible assumptions about differences in marginal propensities to consume. Conditions in the labour market were expected to ease further over the coming year or so, to levels consistent with sustained full employment. Employment was expected to continue to grow moderately, though slower than the working-age population, and the unemployment rate and the broader underutilisation rate were expected to increase further. Nominal wages growth was expected to remain robust in the near term before moderating in response to further easing in the labour market. Members noted that the outlook for wages growth was consistent with the inflation target, on the assumption that productivity growth increases to around its long-run average. Members observed that inflation was expected to return to the target range of 2â3Â perÂ cent in 2025 and to the midpoint in 2026. Inflation was anticipated to decline a little quicker than previously thought, because goods price inflation had declined more than expected and domestic demand was also a little softer than previously anticipated. But services inflation remained high and was still expected to decline only gradually as aggregate demand moderates and growth in labour and non-labour costs eases. Financial conditions Members noted that global financial conditions had eased over prior months. Market participantsÂ expectations for reductions in central banksÂ policy rates had been brought forward since the previous meeting. This had occurred in response to lower-than-expected inflation and central bank communication that further policy rate increases were less likely. However, members noted that this had reversed in late January after a number of central bank officials stated that policy rate cuts were not imminent because they were looking for more evidence that low inflation would be sustained. Stronger-than-expected US labour market data had also pushed out market expectations for reductions in policy rates in the days prior to the meeting. At the time of the meeting, market pricing implied an expectation that advanced economy central banks would start reducing policy rates from around the middle of the year. Members noted that fewer reductions in the policy rate were expected in Australia than in many other advanced economies. Market pricing suggested that market participants believed the cash rate had probably reached its peak, with rate cuts of around 50Â basis points expected by the end of 2024. This was broadly consistent with the median forecast of market economists. These expectations suggested that the policy rate in Australia would peak at a lower level than in a number of other advanced economies and decline later. Sovereign bond yields in advanced economies had declined over preceding months in response to the improved inflation outlook and changing expectations for the paths of central bank policy rates. Other measures of financial conditions had also eased. Equity prices had risen to record highs in a number of advanced economies, including Australia, though members noted that the gains in US share prices were narrowly based and valuations there looked stretched. Spreads on corporate bonds had also declined. Nonetheless, the demand for credit generally remained subdued. Corporate bond issuance was below average in the United States and Europe, especially for lower rated corporations, and credit growth in those economies remained low. In discussing these developments, members observed that longer term interest rates were less relevant for financial conditions in Australia than in economies such as the United States. Members also observed that corporate bond issuance was robust in Australia, in contrast to other advanced economies. In China, financial conditions had eased a little alongside some further policy support to address significant economic headwinds, including considerable stress in the property sector. Overall, the scale of monetary policy easing in China had been moderate, with more substantive support for the economy having been delivered through fiscal policy. The Australian dollar had appreciated through late 2023. This had occurred against a backdrop of general USÂ dollar weakness that was underpinned by expectations of near-term cuts to the federal funds rate target. The Australian dollar had since depreciated as these expectations were unwound and had been little changed since early November. The trade-weighted Australian dollar was trading near early 2022 levels. In Australia, financial conditions were considered to be restrictive overall. The tightening of monetary policy had led to a significant rise in household debt payments, which, in combination with other factors, was weighing on disposable incomes and consumption. Required mortgage payments had risen to a historical high as a share of household disposable income. Members noted this share would rise further as remaining low fixed-rate mortgages expire and roll onto higher rates, and the increase in the cash rate in November continues to flow through to payments. By contrast, a broader measure of total household debt payments (relative to disposable income) remained below its estimated peak, as personal credit had declined significantly since 2008. Extra payments into mortgage offset and redraw accounts had also declined since 2022, though they had increased in the second half of 2023. When viewed alongside weak consumption, this increase suggested that many borrowers might be responding to the incentive from higher interest rates to save more and limit their consumption. Members noted that the sharp rise in interest rates had also underpinned a large decline in credit growth from its peak in early 2022. Both housing and business credit growth had stabilised at a lower level over the preceding year. Business credit had been growing a little above its post-2008 average, while housing credit growth was below its average over the same period. Even so, new housing lending had picked up over the preceding year, consistent with the rebound in national housing prices. Considerations for monetary policy Turning to the policy decision, members noted that there had been further progress towards the BoardÂs objectives but that more progress was required and the outlook remained uncertain. Inflation in Australia had declined but was still well above target. Members noted that the moderation in inflation had been driven by softer goods price inflation and that any further slowing in this component was likely to be modest. By contrast, services price inflation remained high and had declined only a little. Members observed that while some components of services inflation were unlikely to be responsive to monetary policy in the near term, there was still a large element that reflected excess demand. Members noted that consumption growth had remained subdued and was a little weaker than previously expected. The slowing in consumer spending reflected the impact on growth in real household disposable income of high inflation and a higher tax and interest burden. Real household disposable income was expected to grow in the period ahead, including because of the anticipated decline in inflation. Despite subdued consumption growth, overall growth in GDP remained modest, supported by a number of other parts of the economy that had been growing strongly. While overall growth had been modest, members agreed that aggregate demand was still high relative to the economyÂs supply potential, which was generating inflationary pressures. Members acknowledged the significant uncertainties around the economic outlook. The most material risks were the potential for inflation to be more persistent than anticipated, productivity growth not to recover as assumed and consumption to weaken more markedly than in the staffÂs central forecast. Members noted that the staffÂs central forecasts were for inflation to return to the target range of 2â3Â perÂ cent in 2025 and to the midpoint in 2026, with the unemployment rate rising modestly as growth in labour supply outpaces growth in employment. This was predicated, however, on inflation expectations remaining anchored around the midpoint of the target range and some assumed recovery in productivity. Members considered the policy implications of a scenario in which inflation expectations instead gradually drift up and another where consumption is materially weaker than in the central forecasts. Members discussed the extent of the tightness in financial conditions. They noted that financial conditions appeared to be quite restrictive on some measures, but less restrictive on others. Members observed that this is consistent with growth in activity varying quite significantly across parts of the economy. In light of these observations, members considered whether to raise the cash rate target by a further 25Â basis points at this meeting or to leave it unchanged. The case to raise the cash rate further centred on the observation that it would take some time for inflation to return to target and the labour market to full employment. Inflation was expected to take a further two years or so to return towards the midpoint of the target range under the central forecast. This was consistent with the staffÂs assessment that aggregate demand remains above the economyÂs supply potential. Members noted that an increase in the cash rate target at this meeting could slow the growth of demand further and reduce the risk of inflation not returning to target in an acceptable timeframe. Increasing the cash rate target now would not prevent the Board from easing monetary policy if the economy were to weaken more sharply than envisaged. The case to leave the cash rate target unchanged at this meeting centred on the observation that the risk of inflation not returning to the BoardÂs target within a reasonable timeframe had eased. The moderation in inflation over preceding months had been slightly larger than previously expected, and global inflation outcomes had provided additional confidence that inflation in Australia would moderate further. Data on the labour market and consumer spending had also been weaker than previously expected. Members noted that it was possible that conditions in the labour market were already consistent with full employment, although this was judged to be unlikely. Members noted that the staffÂs central forecasts were for inflation to return to target within the timeframe that they had previously concluded was acceptable, and for conditions in the labour market to be broadly consistent with full employment in a year or so. Both of these forecasts were predicated on a technical assumption for the cash rate, derived from market economistsÂ forecasts and market pricing, that include no additional increase in the cash rate. Members observed that the risks around the outlook were broadly balanced; there was a risk that inflation proves more persistent but there was also a risk that consumer spending weakens more sharply than it had to date. Given these observations, it was reasonable to conclude that leaving the cash rate unchanged at this meeting, and continuing to monitor how risks to the outlook evolve, was the most appropriate course of action. In weighing up these two options, members judged that the case to leave the cash rate target unchanged was the stronger one. They agreed that doing so would best balance the BoardÂs objectives for price stability and full employment. Members noted that the data had evolved in a manner that gave them more confidence that inflation would return to target within a reasonable timeframe while allowing employment to continue to grow. Members then considered the options for how to communicate the BoardÂs decision in the post-meeting statement. They agreed to communicate that there had been progress towards meeting the BoardÂs inflation objective. At the same time, members noted that it would take some time before they could have sufficient confidence that inflation would return to target within a reasonable timeframe. Uncertainty about the outlook for the economy was high. Members also observed that the costs of inflation not returning to target within the envisaged timeframe were potentially very high. Given this, members agreed that it was appropriate not to rule out a further increase in the cash rate target. They also agreed that it would be important to continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. Members reiterated their resolve to do what is necessary to return inflation to target. In light of these conclusions, members agreed that it was important for the BoardÂs public statement to make clear that inflation had moderated but was still high, and that it was not yet possible to rule in or out further increases in interest rates. Members also agreed on the importance of highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook and the need for monetary policy to be driven by developments in relevant data, the outlook for the economy and the evolving risks.

2024-03-19,"Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board Sydney â 18Â and 19Â March 2024 Members present MicheleÂ Bullock (Governor and Chair), AndrewÂ Hauser (Deputy Governor), IanÂ HarperÂ AO, CarolynÂ HewsonÂ AO, StevenÂ KennedyÂ PSM, IainÂ RossÂ AO, ElanaÂ RubinÂ AM, CarolÂ SchwartzÂ AO, AlisonÂ WatkinsÂ AM Others present BradÂ Jones (Assistant Governor, Financial System), SarahÂ Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), ChristopherÂ Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), CarlÂ Schwartz (Acting Head, Domestic Markets Department) AnthonyÂ Dickman (Secretary), DavidÂ Norman (Deputy Secretary) AndreaÂ Brischetto (Head, Financial Stability Department), MarionÂ Kohler (Head, Economic Analysis Department), SallyÂ Cray (Chief Communications Officer), MeredithÂ Beechey Osterholm (Future Hub) Domestic economic conditions Members commenced their discussion of domestic economic conditions by assessing the recent data on output growth. They noted that growth had slowed further in the December quarter, largely as expected. Aggregate demand had been supported over 2023 by strong growth in business investment and public spending, and members considered how likely it was this would continue in 2024. Members also noted, however, that household consumption growth had been very weak and negative in per capita terms, as high inflation and increases in interest rates and tax payments had weighed on real incomes. They observed that real household disposable income had begun to grow again and was projected to pick up further as the drag from high inflation abated and pre-announced tax cuts took effect. Members discussed a range of factors that could influence the likelihood that consumption growth would pick up in response. Members observed that growth in underlying demand for housing remained brisk relative to supply, which was contributing to rising prices and rents. On the demand side, population growth remained high and the shift in preferences for more housing space that occurred during the pandemic was yet to unwind, despite worsening affordability. On the supply side, new housing had been constrained by ongoing capacity constraints â particularly for finishing trades and where the required skills were easily transferable to non-residential construction â and rapid increases in construction costs. Advertised rents had continued to grow strongly in most capital cities. Members noted the staffÂs overall assessment that aggregate demand had continued to exceed supply in the latter part of 2023, but that the gap between the two was closing relatively quickly, in line with prior forecasts. Labour market conditions had eased further, as slower output growth had resulted in slowing growth in labour demand. This was evident across a range of labour market indicators, including a further rise in the unemployment rate in January. Members assessed that overall labour market conditions nevertheless remained a little tighter than was consistent with sustained full employment and inflation at target. Wages growth had been robust in the December quarter. Both the data and liaison signalled that wages growth may have reached a peak, with some jobs and industries already seeing an easing in wage pressures. That said, overall wages growth was not expected to decline quickly. Growth in labour costs per unit of output remained very high. It had begun to moderate slightly as measured productivity growth had picked up in the second half of 2023, but members noted that it was still uncertain whether this trend would be sustained. They observed that much of the prior weakness in labour productivity had reflected the effects of the pandemic and the economic cycle, which were likely to unwind over coming years. However, it was also possible that the structural factors adversely affecting productivity growth in the years prior to the pandemic would persist. Members noted that the current level of wages growth remained consistent with the inflation target, but only on the assumption that productivity growth increased to around its long-run average. They considered the implications for monetary policy if productivity did not pick up as assumed, recognising that the associated economic adjustment may not be smooth or immediate. Underlying inflation had continued to moderate, largely in line with the staffÂs forecasts published in February, but it was still high. The monthly CPI indicator excluding volatile items was around 4Â perÂ cent in year-ended terms in January, and had declined below 3Â perÂ cent on a three-month-ended annualised basis. However, a rebound was anticipated in coming quarters as recent declines in fuel prices and the pace of decline of some household goods prices were not expected to persist and electricity rebates were legislated to expire. Members noted that the data were consistent with continuing, but diminishing, excess demand and strong domestic cost pressures, for both labour and non-labour inputs. International economic developments Turning to economic conditions abroad, members observed that inflation had been moderating in many advanced economies, and recent readings were now closer to central banksÂ targets. However, inflation remained uneven across components: energy and goods prices inflation had eased, but housing and core services inflation remained high compared with pre-pandemic rates. And some countries, notably the United States, had seen a modest pick-up in inflation in the most recent data. Members noted the risk that non-tradables inflationary pressures could persist in these economies. Restrictive monetary policy settings had played a part in slowing global output growth, though the risk of significant recession had diminished in major economies over the preceding year. Members observed that activity in the United States had been more resilient than elsewhere. Labour market conditions in major economies had also generally eased a little further but remained tight. The Chinese authorities had announced a target for growth of Âaround 5Â perÂ centÂ for 2024, despite ongoing headwinds to growth. At the same time, additional fiscal policy support had been announced. Members noted that concerns about the outlook for steel demand had weighed on iron ore prices, which was reducing incomes for Australian exporters. Financial conditions Market participantsÂ expectations for the paths of central bank policy rates in advanced economies had risen a little since the previous meeting. This reflected some stronger-than-expected economic data and statements by central bank officials that emphasised the need for further evidence that inflation would sustainably return to targets before central banks started reducing policy rates. Market participants continued to expect that many advanced economy central banks would begin reducing policy rates from around the middle of the year. Members observed that Japan was an exception, with market pricing implying an expectation that the Bank of Japan would end its policy of negative interest rates at an upcoming meeting. Members noted that fewer reductions in the policy rate were expected in Australia than in many other advanced economies. They observed that, in part, this was likely because the cash rate had not risen as high as policy rates in other economies, as the Board had chosen to return inflation to target gradually over time in order to preserve the gains in employment. Members further observed that market expectations were for policy rates to be at broadly similar levels by the end of 2025 across many advanced economies, including Australia. Sovereign bond yields in advanced economies, including Australia, had been little changed since the previous meeting, while the prices of riskier assets had continued to rise. Equity prices had reached new highs, reflecting stronger-than-expected company earnings and a rise in expected future earnings, as well as declines in risk premia as market participants became more confident that economic growth across a range of countries could be maintained while inflation moderates. Corporate bond spreads had also declined to around their lowest levels since 2022, while corporate bond issuance had picked up in preceding months. In China, monetary policy had been eased further to support the economy in the face of significant economic headwinds, particularly stresses in the property sector. Members noted that monetary policy easing had been moderate, with more substantive support for the economy having been delivered through fiscal policy. Chinese equity prices had picked up from recent lows following the increased support from authorities. The Australian dollar had been little changed since the previous meeting, despite a noticeable decline in iron ore prices and a modest decline in the yield differential between Australia and other advanced economies. Members observed that the exchange rate appeared to have been supported by favourable global risk sentiment, noting the historical correlation between the Australian dollar and the price of riskier assets. Overall financial conditions in Australia were considered to have remained restrictive, particularly for households. The tightening in monetary policy had induced a significant rise in scheduled household debt payments. These were expected to rise a little further in 2024 as additional fixed-rate loans rolled onto higher rates. Housing credit growth remained low and payments into offset accounts had risen since mid-2023. Lower income and less-wealthy households had been most affected. As a result, the average housing deposit had increased at a faster rate than housing prices, and newer borrowers had higher incomes and lower loan-to-income ratios relative to earlier cohorts. Financial conditions for the business sector, including in wholesale funding markets, had remained more favourable than for households. While interest expenses had increased for businesses, this had been partly buffered by higher nominal earnings. Business credit growth had remained reasonably strong. Future system for monetary policy implementation Members discussed a paper on options for the future system that the Bank could use to implement monetary policy. They agreed that it was important to plan for this given the decline in Exchange Settlement (ES) balances (ÂreservesÂ) as unconventional monetary policies are unwound. Three broad options for the system to control the cash rate were considered: return to a Âcorridor systemÂ with scarce reserves (similar to that in operation prior to the pandemic); maintain the current Âfloor systemÂ with excess reserves (adopted during the pandemic); or transition to a system where the Bank would provide Âample reservesÂ by meeting demand for ES balances from banks at a pre-set price close to the cash rate target, using full-allotment auctions. Members agreed that each of these options could meet the BankÂs primary objective of ensuring that the cash rate and other short-term market interest rates remain close to the BoardÂs cash rate target. However, members assessed that provision of ample reserves through full-allotment auctions was likely to be the best option to move towards. Under this option, the framework would be more resilient to changes affecting the demand and supply of reserves than would be the case in a scarce reserves system, reducing the risk of unexpected liquidity shortages, among other matters. Members also considered that this would help limit the BankÂs financial risk and would imply a lower risk of distortions in market prices or impairments in market functioning, compared with an excess reserves system. The BankÂs existing operational arrangements are consistent with a transition to ample reserves because current open market operations already include full-allotment auctions. Members discussed the importance of establishing this system in a way that clearly separates liquidity provision for ordinary payments needs or system-wide shifts in liquidity needs from liquidity provision to banks facing idiosyncratic liquidity stress. Members stressed the importance of ES holders â in particular, banks â reflecting on the implications of the prospective framework for their own liquidity management operations as the stock of reserves declines. Members endorsed a proposal to adopt an ample reserves system with full-allotment auctions. They emphasised that, as this decision was an operational one, it had no implications for the stance of monetary policy, nor did it have a bearing on the BoardÂs current approach to bond holdings acquired during the pandemic. Consistent with these considerations, members agreed that it was appropriate for information on the broad shape of the new framework to be communicated to the public through a speech by the Assistant Governor, Financial Markets. Key details of the ample reserves system would need to be considered later in the year, including the configuration of the full-allotment open market operations and guidelines for the composition of the assets on the BankÂs balance sheet. These decisions would be informed by the staffÂs future engagement with stakeholders, including via public consultation. Financial stability assessment Members discussed the BankÂs regular half-yearly assessment of financial stability risks. They observed that pressures from high inflation and the sharp tightening in monetary policy had weighed on the financial position of many households and businesses globally. Nonetheless, the global financial system had proved largely resilient to date. Members noted that one reason for this was generally strong household and corporate balance sheets, following sustained deleveraging over the prior decade or so in major advanced economies that had been particularly affected by the global financial crisis. Private sector borrowing at low fixed rates in these economies had also dampened some of the pass-through from higher policy rates and, along with continued strength in labour markets, had contributed to debt-servicing ratios remaining at the lower end of historical ranges. Members noted that stronger lending standards and prudential regulation following the global financial crisis had also led to improvements in large international banksÂ capital positions, leaving them well placed to weather a decline in asset quality and/or worsening macroeconomic conditions. Nonetheless, global financial stability risks remained high, and members discussed several that were particularly relevant for Australia: Further weakness in the Chinese property sector could interact with longstanding macro-financial vulnerabilities. If stresses in the Chinese economy and financial system intensified or broadened, they could spill over to the rest of the world (including Australia) through trade channels and an increase in global risk aversion. Higher interest rates and ongoing weak demand, particularly for older or lower quality offices, continued to weigh on conditions in global commercial real estate (CRE) markets. Risks were greater among regional banks in the United States and parts of Europe, including in Germany, where CRE exposures were largest and lending standards had eased over prior years. While distressed CRE sales and non-performing loans in international markets had been limited, they could increase in the period ahead as CRE loans had to be refinanced at higher rates in a weaker demand environment. Declining risk premia in debt and equity markets in part reflected market participantsÂ current optimism about the prospects for a soft landing in the global economy. Worse-than-expected macroeconomic outcomes â for example, arising from global inflation proving more persistent than expected or a geopolitical shock â could result in a disorderly adjustment in financial asset prices. Events in recent years had demonstrated the potential for this adjustment to be amplified by vulnerabilities in non-bank financial intermediaries in key global financial centres. Tight market spreads, if they persisted over an extended period, could contribute to a build-up of leverage and future risks to financial stability. Turning to domestic financial stability considerations, members noted that most Australian households remained able to service their debts and meet essential expenses, and this was expected to remain true even if inflation were to prove more persistent than anticipated. Strong conditions in the labour market and the large savings buffers accumulated during the pandemic were helping households adapt to challenging economic conditions and restrictive monetary policy. Many borrowers, including those on lower incomes, had also increased the savings they held in offset and redraw facilities over the preceding year; some were likely to have reduced consumption in order to facilitate this. Members recognised that a small group of borrowers, typically those with modest savings or income buffers, remained under acute financial pressure owing to the effects of high inflation and higher interest rates. However, members observed these developments were more relevant to the near-term outlook for consumption than financial stability. Members discussed the uneven conditions experienced across the business sector. They observed that the strong financial starting position of many businesses was supporting their resilience in the face of a slowing economy. Profit margins of many businesses were around pre-pandemic levels, balance sheets remained strong and arrears on bank loans to businesses were low. Company insolvencies had risen to pre-pandemic levels, although this had been driven largely by smaller businesses, particularly in construction as well as discretionary sectors, which tended to have only modest bank debt. This limited the direct risks to financial stability in Australia. Members noted that banks expected overall loan arrears to pick up further in the period ahead, but to remain low relative to history. This reflected most Australian householdsÂ and businessesÂ strong financial starting positions, resilient labour market conditions and sound lending standards in recent years. BanksÂ high capital levels, profitability and provisions left them well placed to absorb a deterioration in credit quality in the event of worse-than-expected macroeconomic conditions. Lending by Australian non-banks had picked up recently as funding conditions had improved in the securitisation market, and there had been some loosening of lending standards. However, members agreed that risks to financial stability posed by Australian non-bank lenders remained relatively contained, given their small share of overall credit. Despite challenging conditions in the domestic CRE market, there was little evidence to date of financial stress among owners of Australian CRE. Members noted that the limited size and more conservative nature of CRE bank lending in Australia, compared with past cycles, meant the risks to the banking system were lower than in previous downturns. However, the risk of CRE stresses overseas affecting the Australian market had risen over the prior decade with the increase in foreign participation in AustraliaÂs CRE market. Finally, members noted the importance of strengthening financial institutionsÂ operational resilience to threats emanating from outside the financial system. If realised, such threats could have material economic and financial stability consequences. Cyber-attacks and the potential for a further escalation in geopolitical tensions were particularly relevant in this context. Strengthening financial institutionsÂ operational resilience to these threats is therefore an ongoing area of focus for the Bank and other member agencies of the Council of Financial Regulators. Considerations for monetary policy Turning to the policy decision, members noted that the economic data over preceding weeks had been broadly as expected. GDP growth had been below both its historical trend and growth in the population. Consumption had been persistently weak, but this had been partly offset by considerable strength in business investment and above-average growth in public demand. While these outcomes implied the output gap was closing relatively quickly, as anticipated, members noted the staffÂs assessment that aggregate demand still exceeded supply and would be likely to continue to do so for a time. Consistent with this, labour market tightness had abated somewhat, though the pace at which this was occurring had been clouded by shifting seasonal patterns. Members observed that inflation had continued to moderate over prior months, broadly as expected. That said, services inflation remained high and the recent slowing in the pace of monthly inflation had been influenced by several temporary factors. Members observed that the path of disinflation in other countries had not been smooth, which could hold lessons for Australia. Furthermore, while recent data suggested wages growth had peaked, growth in labour costs per unit of output remained strong, even as productivity growth had begun to recover. Members observed that financial conditions in Australia had been little changed overall since the previous meeting. Financial conditions for households remained restrictive, though financial conditions for businesses had eased a little over prior months. Some households were finding it difficult to service their debts and meet essential expenses. However, rates of arrears on housing loans were still low and banks had recently reduced their forecasts of potential loan losses. Risks to the financial system from lending to households and businesses remained contained. In light of these assessments, members agreed that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate target unchanged at this meeting. They agreed that the data received since the previous meeting had been broadly as expected and did not materially alter the outlook for output growth and inflation. In particular, members noted that the data had continued to indicate that inflation was high but gradually returning to target, and that the labour market was moving towards conditions consistent with full employment. Members agreed that leaving the cash rate target unchanged at this meeting was the best way to achieve the BoardÂs strategy of supporting a gradual return of inflation to target and the labour market to full employment. Members debated the balance of risks around the outlook. On the upside, there remained a risk that inflation would take longer to return to target than currently expected, resulting in an upward shift in inflation expectations. Members observed that this could occur if aggregate demand continued to exceed supply for longer than anticipated, productivity growth did not increase sustainably or if services price inflation proved stickier than assumed in the forecasts. On the other hand, members noted the risk that weakness in consumption could continue for longer than expected. In particular, the recovery in real household disposable income growth may not lift consumption growth if households do not respond as expected, perhaps because of a weakening in the labour market. If that occurred, growth in output would be slower than expected and inflation would be likely to decline more quickly. On balance, members considered that the relative probability of these two sets of risks had become a little more even, as the incoming data had not indicated a materialisation of upside risks to inflation and as growth in output had slowed as expected. Members agreed that returning inflation to target remained the BoardÂs highest priority and that it would take some time before they could have sufficient confidence that this would occur within a reasonable timeframe. At the same time, members noted the importance of preserving as many of the gains in the labour market as possible. In light of this and their assessment of the economy, members agreed that it was appropriate to characterise the policy outlook as one in which it was difficult to either rule in or out future changes in the cash rate target. Members remain committed to paying close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. In finalising the BoardÂs statement, members agreed that it was important to convey that recent data and information had not materially changed their views on the outlook. They decided to emphasise that the data indicated the economy was tracking broadly as expected and that while there were significant uncertainties, the risks seemed broadly balanced. Members agreed that it was therefore not possible to either rule in or out future changes in the cash rate target. They agreed to reiterate their resolve to do what is necessary to return inflation to target.

2024-05-07,"Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board Sydney â 6Â and 7Â May 2024 Members present MicheleÂ Bullock (Governor and Chair), AndrewÂ Hauser (Deputy Governor), IanÂ HarperÂ AO, CarolynÂ HewsonÂ AO, StevenÂ KennedyÂ PSM, IainÂ RossÂ AO, ElanaÂ RubinÂ AM, CarolÂ SchwartzÂ AO, AlisonÂ WatkinsÂ AM Others present SarahÂ Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), ChristopherÂ Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets) AnthonyÂ Dickman (Secretary), DavidÂ Norman (Deputy Secretary) MeredithÂ Beechey Osterholm (Future Hub), SallyÂ Cray (Chief Communications Officer), MarionÂ Kohler (Head, Economic Analysis Department), CarlÂ Schwartz (Acting Head, Domestic Markets Department), PenelopeÂ Smith (Head, International Department) International economic conditions Members began their discussion of international economic conditions by noting that the risks to global growth had become more balanced over prior weeks. While national accounts measures of growth in most advanced economies had remained weak, some forward-looking indicators had been more positive. The United States was the exception, where growth had been robust and had moderated only a little in 2024 compared with the very strong rates of 2023. The US labour market had been surprisingly strong over preceding months and labour markets in most other advanced economies remained tight, despite further gradual easing. Inflation in advanced economies remained above central banksÂ targets, despite substantial declines, and progress in lowering inflation appeared to have stalled, in some cases at least temporarily. Core services price inflation remained high and the latest US inflation data had surprised on the upside. Members discussed how more persistent services price inflation could delay the return of inflation to target, particularly in those countries where signs were emerging that disinflation in core goods prices may have run its course. Economic growth had picked up in China early in the year and appeared to be on track to reach the growth target for 2024 of Âaround 5Â perÂ centÂ. Some of this strength was attributable to a rise in net exports. Members noted, however, that conditions in the property market remained very weak and that policy support would still be needed to offset the resulting drag on GDP growth. The prices of iron ore, coking coal and base metals had all risen since the previous meeting, due to some combination of a stronger economic outlook for China and constrained supply. The staff forecast for trade-weighted growth in AustraliaÂs major trading partners had been little changed since the February meeting; while near-term forecasts for output growth in the United States and China had been revised higher, forecasts for some other trading partners had been revised downwards. Domestic economic conditions Consumer spending had continued to be weaker than expected in the first quarter of 2024. By contrast, real household disposable income had started to stabilise at a somewhat higher level than had been anticipated. The developments indicated that households were maintaining a higher rate of saving than had been expected. Members noted that a small share of households were curtailing their spending in the face of income constraints, but many others were simply choosing to reduce their spending. They debated the relative importance of higher returns on savings and greater-than-usual uncertainty among households in driving this outcome, noting that this was a key judgement for the outlook for output and inflation. Both business investment and public sector spending had been growing strongly. Private non-residential construction and investment in software and other forms of intangibles had been important contributors to overall growth in business investment. Members acknowledged that it was not possible to determine accurately the shares of such investment intended to enhance productivity (e.g. artificial intelligence), mitigate risks (e.g. cybersecurity) or meet compliance obligations, though the economic implications of each would be different. Labour market conditions had eased by less than had been anticipated three months earlier. The unemployment rate was still only modestly above its late-2022 trough. The participation rate and employment-to-population ratio also remained near record high levels, though average hours worked and job vacancies had both declined further. Demand was strongest for skilled labour and in government-related sectors. Members debated why employment growth was proving so resilient, noting that this could reflect decisions to hoard labour, marginal workers being less productive, persistently strong population growth, the current composition of demand or a difference in the outlook for spending among consumers and businesses. Different weightings on these factors would imply different implications for the economic outlook. Members discussed the degree of spare capacity in the economy, which was a key judgement required for the outlook. They noted the staffÂs assessment that the level of demand exceeded supply at the end of 2023, though the gap had narrowed relatively quickly owing to subdued growth; it was also noted that such measures are subject to material uncertainty. Conditions in the labour market appeared to be tighter than those consistent with full employment, drawing on historical comparisons for a range of labour market indicators, model-based estimates and information from business surveys. Members discussed the implications of developments in wages and productivity for their assessment of the level of full employment. Inflation had eased further in the March quarter in year-ended terms, but the pace of disinflation had slowed and the recent inflation data were stronger than had been expected in February. Both domestic labour and non-labour cost pressures remained high. Goods price inflation had eased further over prior months, but the pass-through of the earlier easing in import price growth to domestic consumer prices now appeared to be largely complete. Services price inflation had peaked but remained high, particularly for services that are less discretionary. Growth in unit labour costs remained high but had moderated slightly, in line with the recent increase in labour productivity growth. Financial conditions Market participantsÂ expectations for the path of central bank policy rates had risen noticeably since the March meeting. This had been particularly pronounced in the United States and Australia, where recent inflation data had been higher than expected. While market pricing still implied that policy rates had reached a peak in many advanced economies, the expected timing of future reductions in policy rates had been pushed out, to later in 2024 in most cases. As expected, the Bank of Japan had raised its policy rate shortly after the March meeting and had announced an end to its yield curve control and several of its asset-purchasing programs. Sovereign bond yields in most advanced economies had increased since the previous meeting. This was consistent with changes in market expectations for policy rates and a modest increase in financial market measures of inflation expectations in some countries. The easing in some other measures of global financial conditions since late 2023 remained in place. In particular, a range of risk asset prices, including equity prices, were still high. Corporate bond yields had risen, but by less than government bond yields, and conditions in international wholesale funding markets remained favourable. Members observed that such pricing was indicative of investors expecting benign economic outcomes. The Australian dollar had appreciated a little since the previous meeting. This was consistent with a modest widening of yield differentials between Australia and other advanced economies and a recovery in commodity prices. On a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar had been supported by the depreciation of the yen and the renminbi. Members considered overall financial conditions in Australia to be restrictive, particularly for households. They noted that the cash rate was above most estimates derived from a range of models of the so-called Âneutral rateÂ â the level consistent with monetary policy being neither expansionary nor contractionary. However, members acknowledged the considerable uncertainty around estimates of the neutral rate, which make it difficult to draw strong conclusions about the scale of this effect. They considered various developments that may have raised the neutral rate in recent years, while also noting that most of the structural factors that were linked to lowering the neutral rate over the preceding decade had not changed. Members also observed that several household financial indicators were consistent with financial conditions being significantly tighter than the average of the preceding 15Â years, while the results of a comparison of business financial indicators were mixed. Household debt payments had continued to rise as a share of household income. Scheduled mortgage payments had increased further as fixed-rate loans continued to roll onto higher rates. Nonetheless, extra payments by mortgage holders had also increased as a share of disposable income, to be slightly above the pre-pandemic average. This was consistent with households saving more, potentially in response to higher interest rates, thereby contributing to the weakness in consumption growth. Market pricing implied that the cash rate was not expected to be reduced over the year ahead. Indeed, market pricing pointed to around a 40Â perÂ cent chance of one further rate increase in 2024, with reductions in the cash rate seen as likely in 2025. Relative to several other advanced economies, market participants expected fewer cuts in Australia, and for these cuts to begin later. Expectations for the level of the cash rate in Australia at the end of 2025, however, were comparable to those for other advanced economies. On average, market economists expected the RBA to begin cutting the cash rate one or two quarters earlier than implied by market pricing, although some market economists had also noted the possibility of an increase in the cash rate in coming months. Economic outlook Members noted that the staff forecasts were for a period of subdued demand growth during the remainder of 2024, bringing aggregate demand closer to balance with the economyÂs supply potential. The output gap was projected to close more slowly than it had in 2023. A key assumption in the forecasts was that the household savings rate would continue to rise in 2024 and consumption growth would recover more slowly than previously forecast. Members discussed the potential for both weaker outcomes (if the labour market weakened more than expected) or stronger outcomes (if households spent more of the unanticipated additional savings that had built up during the pandemic period). Members noted that the labour market was projected to continue easing, though the easing was now expected to take longer than previously thought. Unemployment was expected to be around the level consistent with the BoardÂs full employment mandate by mid-2025. As in the February forecasts, inflation was expected to reach the target range of 2â3Â perÂ cent in the second half of 2025 and the midpoint in 2026, though this was predicated on a noticeably higher technical assumption for the cash rate than three months earlier. The near-term profile for CPI inflation was somewhat higher than in the February forecast because of the March quarter outcome, a more gradual projected easing in labour market capacity and higher petrol prices. Members observed that the forecasts did not incorporate any measures that may be announced in the forthcoming federal and state budgets for 2024/25. Noting the staffÂs assessment that the risks to the domestic outlook were broadly balanced around the central forecasts, members considered scenarios that illustrated the implications of uncertainty around the level of full employment. These showed that inflation may not return to the target range over the forecast period if the labour market were to be tighter than assumed in the projections; on the other hand, there would be excess unemployment over this period and a faster decline in inflation if the labour market were to have more capacity than assumed. These scenarios illustrated that, while the risks may be balanced, the costs associated with them could be asymmetric because inflation was already projected to be above target for several years in the central forecast. Members observed that the implications for inflation would be qualitatively similar if trend productivity deviated from the assumption underlying the forecasts, and that these scenarios highlighted the importance of monitoring early warning indicators for economic activity, the labour market and inflation. Considerations for monetary policy Turning to considerations for the policy decision, members noted that most of the data received since the previous meeting had been stronger than expected. Taken together, these data suggested that there may be somewhat less slack in the economy than previously assessed. Inflation in Australia had declined more slowly than anticipated. Conditions in the labour market had eased by less than expected over prior months and were tighter than those consistent with full employment. Internationally, the data for both economic growth and inflation had also tended to exceed expectations, and the near-term outlook for output growth in some major economies had improved. The key exception to this trend of stronger-than-expected data related to consumer spending in Australia, where the data had signalled ongoing weakness into 2024. Financial conditions in Australia were judged to be restrictive. Expectations for the future path of policy rates had increased both domestically and in the United States, and financial conditions had tightened in response. Market pricing no longer implied a reduction in the cash rate in 2024, and the Australian dollar had appreciated modestly, though remained within its recent range. Members noted that the staff forecasts still had inflation returning to target within the same timeframe as expected in February, but that this was predicated on a technical assumption for the cash rate that was noticeably higher than previously assumed. The forecasts were for output growth to remain subdued in 2024, bringing aggregate demand and supply into closer balance. Labour market conditions were forecast to moderate gradually, and the unemployment rate was expected to be consistent with full employment by mid-2025. Members discussed the key judgements in the staff forecasts. These were: consumption growth would remain weak for most of 2024, despite the stronger outlook for growth in income and wealth, which have been the key determinants of consumption in the past; there was now somewhat less spare capacity in the labour market than previously assumed, given the unexpectedly gradual easing of conditions; and inflation would continue to moderate, despite recent information signalling more persistence than previously assessed. If these judgements prove wrong, the forecasts for inflation and the labour market would need to be materially altered. Members reviewed the strategy adopted by the Board over the preceding two years. This involved setting monetary policy to return inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe while supporting a gradual adjustment of labour market conditions to full employment. The strategy balanced the risk of inflation expectations drifting higher against the risk of inducing a pronounced rise in unemployment. Members recognised that there were significant costs associated with both risks and agreed that the strategy of seeking to balance the two remained appropriate. However, they expressed limited tolerance for inflation returning to target later than 2026. Given these observations, members considered their decision on the cash rate. Raising the cash rate at this meeting could be appropriate if the Board formed a view that the judgements underpinning the staff forecasts risked being overly optimistic about the forces that would drive down inflation, leaving the balance of risks tilted to the upside. The flow of data since the previous meeting had mostly been stronger than expected. The forecasts had also placed significant weight on the downside risks to consumption. Against that view, it was possible that consumer spending could pick up somewhat more rapidly if labour market outcomes remained benign, real household disposable income were to recover and balance sheets remained relatively strong for most households. If accompanied by further growth in public demand and business investment, this could sustain aggregate demand above the economyÂs supply potential and delay the return of inflation to target. A higher cash rate might also be required, even with ongoing weakness in aggregate demand, if other factors slowed the pace of disinflation. Members observed that this could occur if trend productivity growth turned out to be weaker than assumed, unless wages growth were to moderate in response. A drift higher in inflation expectations, should it occur, would also make it more costly to return inflation to target. By contrast, the case to hold the cash rate steady at this meeting was premised on the view that, while there had been notable updates on the state of the economy since the previous meeting, the updates had not been sufficient to warrant a change in the stance of monetary policy. Inflation was still declining towards the target and the recent information did not materially alter its trajectory. Furthermore, the forecasts showed a credible path by which the Board could meet its objectives in a timeframe that was consistent with the BoardÂs strategy. These forecasts were underpinned by key judgements that were considered sound and resulted in a balanced set of risks around the central forecasts. Holding the cash rate steady could also be an appropriate way to mitigate the risk that future demand growth turned out to be slower than envisaged in the forecasts, bringing inflation back to target more quickly than assumed and pushing unemployment well above the level consistent with full employment. That could come about, for example, if consumer spending remained subdued for a more prolonged period as the labour market softened, in turn dampening business investment and hiring. In that scenario, the current path of the cash rate implied by financial markets could turn out to be too high. Similarly, members observed that there is uncertainty about the rate of unemployment that is consistent with full employment. Holding the cash rate steady could be an appropriate way to mitigate the risk that the labour market is already close to full employment, which would bring inflation back to target somewhat sooner than envisaged. In weighing up these options, members judged that the case to leave the cash rate unchanged at this meeting was the stronger one. They agreed that the flow of information since the previous meeting had increased the risks of inflation staying above target for longer. However, members considered that the staff forecasts presented a credible path back to the inflation target, with the risks surrounding the forecasts judged to be balanced. Importantly, inflation expectations remained well anchored. Given this, and the higher-than-usual level of uncertainty about the economic outlook, members judged that it remained reasonable to look through short-term variation in inflation to avoid excessive fine-tuning. In finalising the BoardÂs statement, members agreed that it was important to convey that recent data and other information had signalled that the risks around inflation had risen somewhat. They also agreed that returning inflation to target remained the BoardÂs highest priority. This process was unlikely to be smooth and members recognised the considerable uncertainty about the outlook for both inflation and the labour market. Given this, members agreed that it was difficult either to rule in or rule out future changes in the cash rate target. They reiterated their resolve to do what is necessary to return inflation to target, and to continue paying close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.

2024-06-18,"Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board Hybrid â 17Â and 18Â June 2024 Members participating MicheleÂ Bullock (Governor and Chair), AndrewÂ Hauser (Deputy Governor), IanÂ HarperÂ AO, CarolynÂ HewsonÂ AO, StevenÂ KennedyÂ PSM, IainÂ RossÂ AO, ElanaÂ RubinÂ AM, CarolÂ SchwartzÂ AO, AlisonÂ WatkinsÂ AM Others participating SarahÂ Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), ChristopherÂ Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), JamesÂ Holloway (Deputy Head, Economic Analysis Department) AnthonyÂ Dickman (Secretary), DavidÂ Norman (Deputy Secretary) MeredithÂ Beechey Osterholm (Future Hub), SallyÂ Cray (Chief Communications Officer), MarionÂ Kohler (Head, Economic Analysis Department), CarlÂ Schwartz (Acting Head, Domestic Markets Department), PenelopeÂ Smith (Head, International Department) International economic conditions Members began their discussion of international economic developments by noting that recent data had confirmed that output growth in most advanced economies had troughed and that upside risks might be crystallising in some regions. Forecasters had revised up their expectations for growth in advanced economies for the current year, reflecting stronger-than-expected data for the March quarter amid improving global business sentiment. Nonetheless, restrictive monetary policy was still weighing on demand in most advanced economies and conditions in labour markets were also easing, although generally they remained tight. Members observed that inflation was still above central bank targets in most economies, and services price inflation had generally been stronger than expected since the start of the year. However, in some economies where output gaps were clearly negative, such as Canada and Sweden, services price inflation had continued to moderate. Indicators of activity for the Chinese economy had softened a little following strong growth in the March quarter, but the staffÂs outlook for growth in 2024 had not changed. ChinaÂs external demand remained strong and was being supported by the nascent recovery in activity in advanced economies. Members observed that the recent announcement of new US and EU tariffs on some Chinese imports was further evidence of the increasing risk of broader trade tensions. Domestic economic conditions Turning to the domestic economy, members discussed the national accounts data for the March quarter. They noted the staffÂs assessment that aggregate demand had continued to exceed aggregate supply but that the gap was closing. Growth in GDP had been weak, reflecting subdued activity in the more interest rate-sensitive parts of the economy, such as retail spending and housing construction. Relative to expectations, growth in overall household and public consumption in the March quarter had been stronger than expected while other components had surprised on the downside. Members considered the implications for future growth of developments in these components. The level of consumer spending over the preceding 18Â months had been revised upwards. Much of the upside surprise had been driven by large revisions to overseas travel, which were recorded as imports and so did not alter the measure of overall GDP. Estimates of household income had been little changed, implying downward revisions to estimates of the saving rate. These revisions had brought consumption growth more into line with the usual historical relationships with household income and wealth. Members assessed the signal to take from these revisions. One interpretation was that, on average, households were not being as cautious in their spending as previously thought. Another was that the fall in the saving rate would leave households even more financially squeezed than previously assessed. Members agreed that distinguishing between these alternative hypotheses was important in assessing the outlook for activity and inflation. But any conclusion could only be tentative, given that estimates of savings are prone to significant revision. Further, the latest estimates portrayed a different picture than that derived from data on mortgage-holdersÂ offset accounts, which showed that households were making larger extra payments than prior to the pandemic. Since the previous meeting, a number of Australian governments had released their budgets for 2024/25. Energy rebates and rent assistance would lower headline inflation in 2024, though this direct effect would be reversed later in 2025. Members noted that the staff would incorporate an assessment of the impact of the budgets on the outlook for output and inflation in the August forecasting round. The labour market was still assessed as tight relative to full employment, though conditions had continued to ease gradually in recent months as expected. The easing in the labour market since late 2022 had occurred through an increase in the unemployment rate, a decline in average hours worked and fewer job vacancies. Employment growth had slowed over this period to be around the pace of growth in the working-age population. Recent employment growth had been supported by growth in industries where public funding was important. Members noted that wages growth had likely passed its peak for the current cycle. The easing in wages growth over the year to the March quarter had been broadly based, but outcomes in public and private enterprise bargaining agreements had been a little below expectations. Nonetheless, it was too early to determine if this signalled a more rapid easing in aggregate wages growth than currently expected. The Fair Work CommissionÂs decision on award wages, which had been largely in line with expectations, would see award-linked wages growth step down this year. The implication of wages growth for inflation depended on its effect on unit labour costs, growth in which had moderated recently but remained high. Members discussed recent information from the RBAÂs liaison program. Firms were continuing to report upward pressure on costs, stemming from a range of sources. At the same time, firms in consumer-facing industries were reporting that it was becoming more difficult to raise prices, resulting in a narrowing of margins. Members noted that businesses appeared to be more focused on improving efficiency than they had been for some time, but obtaining internal approval for investments to automate processes was sometimes difficult as firms continued to look for ways to manage cashflow. They also noted the data showing a sharp increase in business insolvencies, although the share of firms entering bankruptcy remained in line with its historical average. Inflation remained above the target range and had been a little higher than expected in prior months. The monthly CPI indicator for April had exceeded expectations because of stronger-than-expected durable goods price inflation. However, there had been limited information about market services price inflation since the May meeting. Members acknowledged that these (limited) inflation data had increased the risk that sustainable progress towards the inflation target may be slower than forecast. Members judged that longer term inflation expectations in Australia were still anchored but should continue to be monitored closely. Several measures of inflation expectations had drifted up in recent years to be around the midpoint of the target band, after having been below target during the low-inflation period prior to the pandemic. Part of the increase in market-implied measures of inflation compensation over preceding years appeared to reflect larger premia to compensate for the risk that inflation turned out to be higher than expected. Members acknowledged that if inflation expectations were to rise materially from current levels, it could require significantly higher interest rates to bring inflation back to target, with adverse implications for growth in output and employment. Financial conditions Market participantsÂ expectations for the path of central bank policy rates in advanced economies were little changed since the May meeting, after increasing steadily in the first few months of the year. Market participantsÂ implied expectation continued to be that policy rates for most major central banks were around their peak, with cuts priced in over the second half of 2024. As expected, the Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank and Sveriges Riksbank had reduced their policy rates in response to weaker-than-expected indicators of economic activity, the emergence of spare capacity and progress on disinflation. However, these central banks had stated that they judged their monetary policy settings still to be restrictive and may need to remain so for some time. Other advanced economy central banks were waiting for more evidence that inflation would return to target sustainably. In particular, the US Federal Reserve had highlighted the persistence of inflation, resilient economic activity and ongoing labour market tightness. Sovereign bond yields in most advanced economies had declined a little since the May meeting. But yields were still higher than at the start of the year and when central banks had commenced raising policy rates. At the same time, some measures of global financial conditions had eased since late 2023. A range of risk asset prices, including equity prices, had risen further. Corporate bond yields had also risen by less than government bond yields since the start of the year, and conditions in international wholesale funding markets remained favourable. Members noted the volatility in European financial markets that had occurred following the European parliamentary elections. In China, credit growth had moderated, particularly for the household sector, against the backdrop of ongoing stress for property developers. The authorities had implemented new measures to address weakness in the property sector, including by providing funding to allow state-owned enterprises to purchase unsold homes from developers. Members noted assessments that these measures would provide helpful support to the property market but were not sufficiently large to affect prospects for the sector materially. For Australia, members concluded that overall financial conditions were restrictive, based on a range of measures. This was most notable for households and less so for large businesses. Required household debt payments had risen further. The rise in these payments had put pressure on the budgets of debtors and had contributed to the weakness in consumption growth. Despite the drag on income from cost-of-living pressures and higher required debt payments, extra mortgage payments were now a little above their pre-pandemic average. This is consistent with the incentive for debtors to reduce their net debts where possible when interest rates are high. Members acknowledged, alternatively, that this could reflect concerns about the economic outlook. By contrast, the (gross) saving rate had declined to be around 2Â½Â percentage points below its pre-pandemic average, following substantial revisions to consumption in the March quarter national accounts. Members discussed how the fall in the measured saving rate and the rise in extra mortgage payments might be reconciled. Household credit growth was somewhat below average but had picked up a little in 2024. After accounting for the extra payments into offset accounts, housing credit growth had been further below average and had not picked up. Moreover, household credit outstanding had been declining as a share of household disposable income. By contrast, business credit growth had remained a little above its post-global financial crisis average and larger firms had continued to raise significant funds from bond markets this year, despite materially higher interest rates. Market pricing implied that markets were not expecting a near-term change in the cash rate, having earlier priced in some prospect of an increase. A rate cut was now not fully priced in until March 2025. The median expectation of market economists was also for the first reduction in the cash rate to occur in March 2025, about three months later than expected at the time of the previous meeting. Further ahead, market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to converge to a similar level to the policy rates in many other advanced economies in coming years. The expectation by market participants of later and fewer cuts than in other advanced economies might have reflected their assessment that the cash rate was closer to estimates of the neutral rate, in large part because the cash rate had not been increased to the same extent in Australia. The Australian dollar had appreciated slightly since the May meeting and, on a trade-weighted basis, was near the top of the range observed since early 2022. Considerations for monetary policy Turning to considerations for the policy decision, members noted that there had been several pieces of information since the May meeting that indicated a need to remain alert to upside risks to inflation. There had been further evidence that global growth had troughed in late 2023 and was gradually picking up, while disinflation had slowed in several countries. In Australia, inflation had also been higher than expected in April. And the revisions to historical estimates of consumer spending meant that consumption growth, while still weak, had been more resilient than previously assessed. Against this, members noted that GDP growth in Australia in the March quarter had been very weak and slightly lower than had been expected. There had also been further evidence that wages growth had likely peaked in late 2023. The labour market was continuing to ease gradually, broadly in line with expectations. Members noted that, despite restrictive financial conditions overall in Australia, growth in business debt had been a little above its post-global financial crisis average and the equity risk premium was low. A few other central banks had moved to a less restrictive policy stance by reducing their policy rates, while others were waiting for more evidence that inflation would return to target sustainably before easing. Members discussed the evolution of some key judgements relative to those underpinning the staffÂs forecasts in May. They noted that, on one view, the revisions to historical estimates of consumption challenged the earlier judgement that consumer spending would pick up only modestly as aggregate real disposable income recovered. At the same time, it was possible to interpret the revisions as implying that households were under more financial pressure than previously assessed, given the decline in the saving rate. Members noted that the August forecast round would provide an opportunity for the staff to carefully review the extent of spare capacity in the labour market and the economy more broadly. They observed that judgements about measures of spare capacity were very uncertain and should be treated with caution when setting policy. And while monetary policy was restrictive, an important judgement was whether policy settings were sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to target within the timeframe implicit in the BoardÂs strategy. Given these observations, members considered their decision on the cash rate. Raising the cash rate at this meeting could be appropriate if members formed the view that policy settings were not sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe. This could be the case if it was judged that inflation was returning to target more slowly than previously assumed or that the gap between aggregate demand and aggregate supply was not closing quickly enough. Members noted that several pieces of new information could imply that demand was likely to hold up better than expected. The staffÂs forecasts from May had incorporated significantly more weakness in consumption than implied by historical relationships with the forecasts for income and wealth; the revisions to the consumption profile had brought these variables into closer alignment over the prior 18Â months. A gradual strengthening of the global economic cycle would also support demand in Australia. And financial conditions for businesses appeared to have eased a little over preceding months for some larger businesses. Collectively, these developments could limit the extent to which current policy settings were sufficient to bring aggregate demand back into line with aggregate supply. Moreover, recent inflation data â both domestically and from abroad â suggested some upside risk to the May forecast profile, since inflation was taking longer to abate than had previously been assumed. Members observed that the forecasts of several other central banks could be interpreted as implying that some spare capacity was necessary to bring inflation back to target within a reasonable timeframe, but that this was not the approach that had been adopted by the Board. The case to raise the cash rate could be further strengthened if members judged that aggregate supply was likely to be more constrained than had been assumed. Members noted that productivity growth remained very weak. And while inflation expectations were judged to be consistent with the inflation target, the increase in the market-implied risk premium suggested a higher risk of an increase in inflation expectations more widely. By contrast, the case to hold the cash rate steady at this meeting was based on the view that the economy was still broadly tracking on a path consistent with returning inflation to target in 2026, while preserving as many of the gains in employment as possible. Inflation had fallen significantly from its peak in late 2022, inflation expectations were assessed to be consistent with the BoardÂs target and there was evidence that the pace of wages growth had peaked in late 2023. Output growth had continued to be weak and the output gap was closing. Members also acknowledged that it might be wise to give little weight to the signal for inflation from some pieces of information received since the May meeting. In particular, there were several reasons not to place too much weight on the revisions to consumption, including that much of the upside surprise had been related to imports, and it was extremely difficult to assess spare capacity accurately in real time. The case to hold the cash rate steady at this meeting would also be strengthened to the extent that risks to the outlook for the labour market were seen to be to the downside. Members observed that the fall in vacancy rates, for example, could be taken as an indication that labour market conditions were already weaker than implied by trends in employment. Moreover, the unemployment rate could rise quickly once it did start to rise, as had occurred in the past. Members acknowledged that, while the current rate of business failures as a share of all businesses was not unusual, a continuation of the rapid rise in insolvencies over coming months would have adverse implications for labour demand. In weighing up these options, members judged that the case to leave the cash rate unchanged at this meeting was the stronger one. Members agreed that the collective data received since the May meeting had not been sufficient to change their assessment that inflation would return to target by 2026, despite some elevated upside risk around the forecast. In addition, members judged that there had not been enough evidence that the outlook for aggregate demand had strengthened, noting uncertainty around the data for consumption and clear evidence that many households were experiencing financial stress. Members also affirmed their assessment that it was still possible to achieve the BoardÂs strategy of returning inflation to target in a reasonable timeframe without moving away significantly from full employment, even though this Ânarrow pathÂ was becoming narrower. With economic uncertainty heightened at present, members emphasised the importance of paying close attention to developments in the economic data. In finalising the BoardÂs statement, members agreed that it was important to convey that the information received since the previous meeting had reinforced the need to be vigilant to upside risks to inflation, and that the extent of uncertainty at present meant it was difficult either to rule in or rule out future changes in the cash rate target. The Board will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. Returning inflation to target remains the BoardÂs highest priority and it will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome.

2024-08-06,"Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board Sydney â 5Â and 6Â August 2024 Members present MicheleÂ Bullock (Governor and Chair), AndrewÂ Hauser (Deputy Governor), IanÂ HarperÂ AO, CarolynÂ HewsonÂ AO, StevenÂ KennedyÂ PSM, IainÂ RossÂ AO, ElanaÂ RubinÂ AM, AlisonÂ WatkinsÂ AM Members had granted leave of absence to Carol SchwartzÂ AO, in accordance with section 18A of the Reserve Bank Act 1959. Others present SarahÂ Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), ChristopherÂ Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets) AnthonyÂ Dickman (Secretary), DavidÂ Norman (Deputy Secretary) MeredithÂ Beechey Osterholm (Future Hub), SallyÂ Cray (Chief Communications Officer), NatashaÂ Cassidy (Deputy Head, Economic Analysis Department), CarlÂ Schwartz (Acting Head, Domestic Markets Department), PenelopeÂ Smith (Head, International Department) Economic conditions Members began their discussion by considering developments in aggregate demand. Domestic demand had been a little stronger in early 2024 than had been expected in May, driven by household and public consumption. That said, household consumption growth remained well below pre-pandemic averages, even after the upward revisions to consumption from mid-2022 to the end of 2023, as discussed at the June meeting. The upside surprise in domestic demand had also occurred alongside robust growth in imports, leaving GDP growth somewhat lower than expected in the March quarter. The available data suggested that household consumption had declined further on a per capita basis in the June quarter, but that the pre-conditions for a gradual pick-up in consumption growth remained in place. Real disposable incomes had stabilised earlier in the year and were expected to increase; prior strong growth in household net wealth would also provide some support to household consumption. There had been limited and preliminary indications that consumer confidence had increased a little in July following the implementation of the Stage 3Â tax cuts. However, some households remained under significant financial pressure, particularly those with limited or no financial buffers. Members discussed the potential implications of varying trends in income and wealth. Conditions in residential construction remained challenging. New dwelling supply had weakened, and ongoing cost pressures and labour shortages were constraining how quickly the pipeline of residential projects could be worked through. The shortage of labour was due, in part, to competition for workers from high levels of non-residential building activity. Liaison contacts expected activity on both detached homes and new apartments to slow over the year ahead, given the ongoing cost pressures and the subdued flow of new dwelling approvals. While there was still strong growth in underlying demand for housing, this had diminished slightly as the average household size had increased, possibly in response to higher rents and housing prices. Labour market conditions in the June quarter had continued to ease gradually. The unemployment rate had increased a little but remained only modestly above its late-2022 trough. Members noted that the rise in the unemployment rate owed more to reduced flows of workers into employment than an increase in layoffs, which remained very low. Both the participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio remained high, and average hours worked had been a little higher than previously expected. Members also observed that the level of job vacancies remained well above both its pre-pandemic average and outcomes in other advanced economies, despite falling significantly from its peak. Many firms continued to report that finding suitable labour is an ongoing challenge. Members discussed the June quarter inflation data, which were broadly in line with the forecast in May. Underlying inflation had eased a little, but in quarterly terms the outcome was not much lower than it was a year earlier. Inflation in prices of market services had eased in the June quarter but remained high, given persistently strong growth in both labour and domestic non-labour costs. Members discussed trends in inflation for items whose prices are either regulated or partially indexed to past inflation, which collectively account for about one-quarter of the CPI basket. They noted that while overall inflation in these items had been high, this was consistent with historical experience. By contrast, inflation in the remainder of the CPI basket had been well above its historical average. Members discussed the degree of spare capacity in the economy, which was a key judgement underpinning the staff forecasts. Based on the data and evidence over a period of time, the staff had assessed that the economy had less spare capacity than previously assumed. This reflected higher inflation outcomes over the preceding 12â18Â months than could be explained by previous estimates of excess demand, and signals from labour market indicators and survey measures of capacity utilisation. Members discussed the considerable uncertainty around estimates of spare capacity and the need to reassess this judgement regularly as the data evolve. Economic outlook Members noted that the staff forecast for GDP growth over the year ahead had been revised higher. This was driven by an upward revision to the forecast for domestic final demand as the outlook for both household consumption and public demand had strengthened. Household consumption growth was expected to pick up in the second half of 2024, supported by an increase in real income growth from the Stage 3Â tax cuts and declining inflation, as well as higher wealth. By contrast, the expected recovery in dwelling investment was now forecast to occur a little later than previously assumed. Despite the upward revisions, growth in GDP was still projected to remain below growth in aggregate supply for a period, bringing the economy to a more balanced state and thereby reducing inflationary pressure. However, considerable uncertainty around this judgement remained. The labour market was expected to continue to ease gradually before stabilising in early 2026, consistent with the signal from leading indicators of labour demand such as job vacancies and hiring intentions. The forecast increase in the unemployment rate was consistent with the anticipated mildness of the downturn. The staff expected that the adjustment to slowing demand would continue to occur, in part, through lower average hours. Members discussed a scenario prepared by the staff in which the unemployment rate picked up more sharply, as had been the case in some peer economies, returning inflation to target sooner. They noted that this would be more likely to occur if businesses were currently hoarding labour. While the evidence that this was occurring seemed limited, members were alert to the possibility that labour demand could soften, perhaps quite rapidly. Wages growth was judged to be past its peak and was expected to slow gradually as the labour market eased. Members debated how far â and how rapidly â wages growth would slow, and the implications of this for inflation, given the easing in the labour market, the structure of recent enterprise bargaining agreements and the declines in real wages since 2021. They also noted the need for productivity growth to recover in order to help reduce growth in unit labour costs. Members discussed the potential causes of the weakness in productivity growth since the pandemic, the impact of changes to industry composition and explanations for why productivity outcomes had been much stronger in the United States than elsewhere. The forecast for underlying inflation had been revised higher since May. This reflected the stronger forecast for aggregate demand and the staffÂs judgement that potential supply in the economy was less than previously assessed. As such, the forecast return to the inflation target range of 2â3Â perÂ cent was expected to be a little later than anticipated in May, and the central forecast had inflation approaching the midpoint in 2026. Headline inflation was expected to dip temporarily below 3Â perÂ cent in the year ahead, owing to new and extended electricity rebates and rent assistance, but then rebound following the legislated unwinding of some of these policies in mid-2025. Members observed that a range of uncertainties could influence the outlook for inflation, including the evolution of the labour market, household saving behaviour and the extent of spare capacity, as well as global geopolitical developments. Members also noted the uncertainty surrounding future population growth. While requirements for offshore student visa applications had been tightened and the government had proposed caps on international student numbers, past population growth had surprised on the upside. Members noted, however, that the impact of population growth on inflation is not straightforward as it affects both aggregate demand and supply capacity. Financial conditions Members discussed developments in global financial markets and the significant bout of volatility prevailing at the time of the meeting. Members noted that several advanced economy central banks â including the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Sveriges Riksbank â had lowered their policy rates in recent months. Market participants expected other central banks â including the US Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand â to do likewise at coming meetings. This reflected progress on returning inflation to central banksÂ targets and a softening in labour market conditions in several advanced economies. By contrast, the Bank of Japan had increased its policy rate and accelerated the process of balance sheet reduction, citing greater confidence that it would sustainably achieve its 2Â perÂ cent inflation target. Members observed that the publication of weaker-than-expected US payroll data for July had triggered significant volatility in global financial markets. These data had caused market participants to expect a much faster pace of policy easing by the US Federal Reserve and some other central banks. Market sentiment had also been affected by a range of other factors, including US corporate financial results, questions about the optimistic valuations of some large technology companies, concerns about rising geopolitical tensions and investorsÂ portfolio adjustments. Government bond yields in most advanced economies had declined in response to the revised expectations for central bank policy rates. Risk asset prices, including for equities, had also fallen as markets reassessed the outlook for growth in advanced economies; this had followed a period of strong appetite for risk in financial markets, which had prompted increases in equity prices in May and June, in some cases to record highs. The declines in global equity prices had been most notable in Japan. In large part, this reflected the significant appreciation of the yen in response to a narrowing of interest rate differentials between Japan and the rest of the world, which was weighing on the earnings outlook for Japanese exporters. It had also reflected an associated unwinding of so-called Âcarry tradesÂ, whereby market participants borrow in yen at low interest rates to invest in higher yielding assets denominated in other currencies. The unwinding of yen carry trades was likely to be amplifying the decline in riskier asset prices globally. Members noted that, at the time of the meeting, it was too soon to tell where financial markets would eventually settle. Most markets had continued to function well, and there were early indications that conditions had begun to stabilise. In China, authorities had eased monetary policy modestly amid weak demand for credit, slowing economic activity and an uncertain economic outlook. Chinese Government bond yields had declined to historical lows and credit demand had eased further, particularly from households, as the protracted contraction in the property sector continued to weigh on the sentiment of consumers and home buyers. The authorities had continued to direct lending towards priority sectors â such as science, technology and manufacturing â which had helped to offset some of the impact of the property sector contraction on commodity prices. The Australian dollar had depreciated on a trade-weighted basis since the previous meeting but remained within the range of recent years. A widening of interest rate differentials between Australia and other major advanced economies had supported the Australian dollar in early July. However, the appreciation had unwound amid the more recent deterioration in risk sentiment, liquidation of Australian dollar positions related to Japanese yen carry trades and declines in some key commodity prices. Members discussed the materiality of these recent market movements and observed that, if sustained, they could limit the pace of disinflation. For Australia, members observed that financial conditions appeared to be less restrictive than had previously been the case. While the cash rate remained above estimates of the neutral rate, market participants had lowered their expectations for the path of the cash rate and there had been associated declines in bond yields. Housing credit growth had gradually increased, suggesting households had been more willing to borrow. Meanwhile, business credit growth had picked up and was well above its average since the global financial crisis. Funding conditions more generally for Australian financial and non-financial corporations remained favourable. Members discussed conditions facing smaller businesses, including information from the BankÂs 32nd annual Small Business Finance Advisory Panel in July. When combined with information from the liaison program and from economic indicators and surveys, it was affirmed that conditions for small businesses were somewhat weaker than those for larger firms. Business insolvencies had increased, including for medium-sized enterprises, though were still below their pre-pandemic trend. Panellists reported that financial conditions generally had tightened over the prior year, mainly because of stricter lending standards. Bank lending to small businesses had not increased for some years. Market expectations for the cash rate had moved materially in the run-up to the meeting, including falling in response to the June quarter CPI release and the shift in expectations for US monetary policy. Market pricing implied an expectation that the cash rate would be reduced by the end of the year. Considerations for monetary policy Turning to considerations for the policy decision, members noted that several developments over preceding months had supported the view that inflation would be slow to decline. Underlying inflation had fallen very little over the prior year in quarterly terms and, while the June quarter outcome had been in line with the staffÂs forecast, inflation was still some way above target. The revised forecast was for inflation to take a little longer than previously thought to return sustainably to target. Members noted that there had also been a pattern since early 2023 of both Bank and market-implied forecasts modestly underpredicting inflation a few quarters in advance. GDP growth remained weak, especially in per capita terms, and the labour market had continued to ease over prior months. Even so, domestic final demand had been stronger than expected over the year to the March quarter, employment growth was still strong and some firms continued to report that labour shortages were a constraint on output. The staffÂs forecast for GDP growth had been revised higher since May. Members observed that two key judgements underpinned the forecast: that consumption growth would recover in line with its historical relationships with income and wealth; and that the labour market would continue to ease gradually but stabilise as GDP growth picks up. Members also discussed a third key judgement: that the gap between aggregate demand and supply was somewhat larger than previously assessed. They observed that the outlook for inflation and conditions in the labour market could be materially different if any of these judgements proved to be mistaken. Members noted that the volatility in financial markets prevailing at the time of the meeting appeared to reflect a combination of market participants reassessing the outlook for US (and hence global) demand, and a partial unwinding of asset valuations that, for certain sectors, had been viewed as optimistic. Whether the adjustments in market prices would persist, however, and their implications for financial conditions were unclear. In light of these developments, members assessed that the risk of inflation not returning to target within a reasonable timeframe had increased. This reflected the slow pace of disinflation over the preceding year, the staffÂs judgement that the gap between aggregate demand and supply was larger than previously assessed, and the upward revision to the forecast for final demand. Members affirmed that their strategy was still to bring inflation back to target within a reasonable timeframe and their tolerance for this timeframe being pushed out further was limited. That said, members noted that the forecasts were uncertain. Importantly, they were also based on a conditioning assumption, derived from market expectations, that the cash rate would be lowered several times in the coming year, beginning later in 2024. Based on what they knew at the time of the meeting, members agreed that monetary policy would need to be tighter than this implied path in order to bring inflation sustainably back to target within a reasonable timeframe. Given these observations, members considered their decision on the cash rate. Raising the cash rate target at this meeting could be appropriate if members judged that the risk that inflation would not return to target in a reasonable timeframe had materially increased, either because of economic developments or because financial conditions were insufficiently tight. Members discussed several developments that could suggest the risk of inflation not returning to the target range by late 2025 had risen materially. Underlying inflation was proving persistent and the central projection was now for inflation to return to target somewhat later than previously forecast. Members also noted that the persistence of cost pressures was a key theme reported by firms in liaison discussions. In addition, the staffÂs assessment was that the gap between aggregate demand and supply would be wider than previously judged throughout the forecast period, because of both a stronger outlook for demand and a reassessment of the economyÂs current spare capacity. Members noted that judgements about this gap were highly uncertain. However, they observed that both model- and survey-based estimates pointed to the level of aggregate demand exceeding supply, and that some estimates implied that the gap was larger than currently assessed. Given membersÂ agreed commitment to prioritise returning inflation to target, these observations could justify an immediate increase in the cash rate. The case to raise the cash rate could be further supported by developments in financial conditions over preceding months. Members noted that financial conditions appeared to have eased modestly, as housing prices and credit growth had picked up and bond yields had declined. The staffÂs forecasts also implied that the future path for the cash rate inferred from market pricing was not sufficient to return inflation to the midpoint of the target range in 2026. The volatility in financial markets complicated this assessment, but membersÂ judgement at the time of the meeting was that the volatility would not have a material effect. Collectively, these considerations could be taken to imply that monetary policy should be tighter to achieve the BoardÂs inflation objective. By contrast, holding the cash rate steady at this meeting â and possibly for an extended period â would be appropriate if members assessed that inflation was still broadly on track to return to target within a reasonable timeframe. It could also be appropriate if the current level of the cash rate was judged to be appropriate to balance the prevailing risks to inflation with those surrounding the outlook for the labour market. Members observed that while underlying inflation was still too high and had fallen only slightly over the prior year, the disinflation in the June quarter had been broadly based across price categories. Inflation was still forecast to decline further as conditions in the labour market eased, and the pace of disinflation would be faster if the staff had overestimated the extent of excess demand. Members observed that there was considerable uncertainty about the inflation outlook and that inflation was forecast to return to the target range even in scenarios that incorporated a stronger outlook for consumption than in the central forecast. In addition, the forecast for when inflation would return to target was conditioned on the cash rate being reduced several times over coming years, including later this year. Members observed that it was possible to achieve a comparable degree of tightening in financial conditions as an increase in the cash rate by holding the cash rate at its current level for longer than the technical conditioning assumption underpinning the forecasts. The case to hold the cash rate steady at this meeting was further supported by the need to balance the risks to the inflation forecast with those surrounding the outlook for full employment. Members noted that it was uncertain whether the forecast pick-up in domestic demand would materialise, given uncertainty around the staffÂs judgements on consumption and the outlook for the labour market. Members noted that scenarios in which either consumption per capita did not grow or in which the unemployment rate increases by more than expected would see inflation return to target sooner than in the central forecast (though possibly still quite gradually). Given this, and the high degree of uncertainty surrounding both the forecasts and the implications of the volatility in financial markets prevailing at the time of the meeting, it could be that holding the cash rate steady best balanced the risks surrounding the outlook for both inflation and the labour market. After weighing up these alternatives, members decided that the case to leave the cash rate target unchanged at this meeting was the stronger one. They agreed that doing so would best balance the risks to both inflation and the labour market, particularly in light of the prevailing uncertainties, market volatility and market expectations. Members noted that it was appropriate to continue placing somewhat greater-than-usual weight on the flow of data, relative to the forecasts, when there were uncertainties about the persistence of supply shocks. In addition, the flow of data since the previous meeting had not been sufficient to warrant a change in the stance of monetary policy. Members also observed that holding the cash rate target steady at its current level for a longer period than currently implied by market pricing may be sufficient to return inflation to target in a reasonable timeframe, but that the Board will need to reassess this possibility at future meetings. In finalising the BoardÂs statement, members agreed that it was important to convey that the information received since the previous meeting had reinforced the need to remain vigilant to upside risks to inflation and that monetary policy will need to be sufficiently restrictive until members are confident that inflation is moving sustainably towards the target range. They also agreed that, based on the information available at the time of the meeting, it was unlikely that the cash rate target would be reduced in the short term, and that it was not possible to either rule in or rule out future changes in the cash rate target. Members will rely upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide the BoardÂs decisions. Returning inflation to target remains the BoardÂs highest priority and it will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome.

2024-09-24,"Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board Hybrid â 23Â and 24Â September 2024 Members participating MicheleÂ Bullock (Governor and Chair), AndrewÂ Hauser (Deputy Governor), CarolynÂ HewsonÂ AO, StevenÂ KennedyÂ PSM, IainÂ RossÂ AO, ElanaÂ RubinÂ AM, CarolÂ SchwartzÂ AO, AlisonÂ WatkinsÂ AM Members had granted leave of absence to Ian HarperÂ AO, in accordance with section 18A of the Reserve Bank Act 1959. Others participating SarahÂ Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), BradÂ Jones (Assistant Governor, Financial System), ChristopherÂ Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets) AnthonyÂ Dickman (Secretary), DavidÂ Norman (Deputy Secretary) MeredithÂ Beechey Osterholm (Future Hub), SusanÂ Black (Acting Head, Domestic Markets Department), AndreaÂ Brischetto (Head, Financial Stability Department), SallyÂ Cray (Chief Communications Officer), MichaelÂ Plumb (Head, Economic Analysis Department), PenelopeÂ Smith (Head, International Department) Economic conditions Members began their discussion by noting that the economic data received since the previous meeting had been broadly in line with the staffÂs expectations. Recent data on inflation had been consistent with a further gradual easing in underlying inflationary pressures. Looking ahead, monthly CPI data for August â to be released the day after the meeting â were expected to show a sharp decline in headline inflation, partly because of federal and state government cost-of-living relief. But underlying inflation was expected to remain above target. Inflation for some components had remained high and persistent, but the easing in the rate of growth in advertised rents over the preceding three months was expected to feed through gradually to lower rent inflation in the CPI. Growth in GDP in the June quarter had been in line with the staffÂs expectations. However, the composition of that growth suggested somewhat less underlying momentum in aggregate demand than the staff had assumed. Notably, household consumption had been significantly weaker than expected, while the offsetting stronger-than-expected outcomes were in components that tended to be more volatile from quarter to quarter. Members observed that weak growth in output was closing the gap between aggregate demand and the economyÂs estimated supply capacity, but that the two were not yet aligned. Members discussed the implications of the weaker-than-expected outcome for household consumption in the June quarter. This was seen to have reflected a combination of a genuine slowing in momentum and the unwinding of one-off spending in the March quarter. Bank transaction data suggested that the recent weakness in household spending had been broadly based across different types of households, including those without mortgages. Strong growth in government consumption â which includes the provision of services to households â meant that overall consumption growth had been more resilient than implied by household consumption alone but was still below its pre-pandemic average. A key question was how spending was evolving in the September quarter. The staff had previously forecast household consumption to strengthen in response to a recovery in real incomes, including because of the implementation of the Stage 3Â tax cuts in July. Members considered whether this forecast was still consistent with available timely indicators of household spending, including the signals derived from bank transaction data and retail sales. These suggested that growth in spending had been weak in July but had strengthened somewhat in August. Retailers in the RBAÂs liaison program had reported that conditions had remained stable over prior months and were generally expected to stay that way over coming months. Based on this information, members judged that it was still reasonable to expect a pick-up in consumption growth over the second half of the year, but it was too soon to form firm views based on these partial indicators and there was some risk that the pick-up could be somewhat slower than previously expected. Members also noted that the official statistical treatment of the cost-of-living subsidies provided to households would have the effect of reallocating measured spending in the September quarter from household to public consumption. Turning to the prospects for trade, members noted that global economic indicators had been somewhat weaker over preceding months. The outlook for the Chinese economy had softened and this had been reflected in weaker demand for iron ore and lower commodity prices, despite the earlier easing of monetary policy. In many advanced economies, conditions in labour markets had eased materially and job vacancies had returned to pre-pandemic levels, unlike in Australia. Inflation had also declined in these economies and central banks had become more confident of returning inflation sustainably to target. In that context, some central banks â including the US Federal Reserve â had focused on downside risks to labour markets in recent communications. The cap on international student commencements to be applied to the higher education and vocational education and training sectors in Australia from 2025 was expected to weigh on services exports. Members noted that the cap was in addition to the earlier tightening in requirements for student visa applicants, which had already seen a fall in student visa grants. However, the implications of lower student arrivals for the balance between aggregate demand and supply, and hence for the inflation outlook, were less clear. Lower numbers of international student arrivals would be likely to reduce aggregate demand (including for housing), but also lower growth in population and therefore the economyÂs supply capacity. The implications of these various effects would be assessed more carefully as part of the subsequent forecast update. Members judged that labour market conditions in Australia were still tight relative to both full employment and conditions in other economies. The share of unemployed people finding jobs was high and the share of workers losing their jobs was very low. Conditions had nonetheless continued to ease as expected and indicators of future labour market conditions suggested that would continue. The unemployment rate had increased a little over preceding months as strong growth in the supply of labour (including through higher participation) was only partially absorbed by solid employment growth. Members noted that the rise in participation reflected a combination of jobs being readily available and the effect of financial pressures from the higher cost of living. Members considered medium-term developments in labour productivity growth, which remained subdued. In part, that reflected a rising share of employment in the non-market sector, where measured productivity had declined over prior years. However, productivity outcomes had also been weak in a range of market industries, a trend evident in many other economies. Overall, the information received from the June quarter national accounts had reinforced concerns about future growth in supply. In turn, this could have implications for the sustainable pace of wages growth. Members noted that wages growth had continued to ease in the June quarter from high levels, broadly as expected. Financial conditions Members commenced their discussion of financial conditions by noting that several advanced economy central banks had reduced their policy rates since the previous meeting, in response to easing labour market conditions and progress in returning inflation sustainably to target; they had also communicated that further policy easing was likely. Market participants expected policy rates to reach central bank estimates of neutral levels by around the end of 2025. An exception was the Bank of Japan, which had communicated that it would be appropriate to raise its policy rate further from current low levels if underlying inflation increased as forecast. Financial market conditions had been calmer following the bout of extreme volatility around the time of the previous meeting. However, several of the factors that had contributed to the volatility remained in place, such as elevated risk-taking and leveraged positions. Members noted that financial market pricing across a range of asset classes in advanced economies was consistent with expectations of a soft economic landing. Sovereign bond yields in most advanced economies had declined further since the August meeting, reflecting both an easing in expectations for policy rates and a decline in inflation expectations. Other measures of financial conditions had also eased as volatility subsided and risk premia declined. Corporate bond yields in the United States and European countries had declined to year-to-date lows, including because of narrower spreads to sovereign bonds. In China, weakness in the property sector had continued to weigh on credit demand and economic activity. Authorities had intervened to lean against declines in longer term government bond yields and the renminbi had appreciated alongside a narrowing of ChinaâUS interest rate differentials. The Australian dollar trade-weighted index had traded within the range observed since early 2022, despite some volatility around the time of the August meeting. The exchange rate had been affected by a widening in yield differentials arising from market participantsÂ expectations that other central banks would reduce their policy rates by more than the RBA. The effect of this on the exchange rate had been offset somewhat by declines in commodity prices. Members judged that Australian financial conditions remained restrictive overall but had eased somewhat over preceding months. Market expectations for the path of the cash rate were materially lower than a few months earlier, and bond yields and some lending and deposit rates had declined in tandem. Housing credit growth had also gradually increased, and business credit growth was above its average pace since the global financial crisis. Funding conditions more generally for Australian financial and non-financial corporations remained favourable. Members discussed the implications of this for future business investment and concluded that it seemed unlikely financial conditions would be a binding constraint on investment for most businesses. While market expectations for the path of the cash rate were lower than a few months earlier, members noted that they had risen in response to the GovernorÂs comments that, based on data to hand at the August meeting, the Board did not expect to lower rates in the near term. Market pricing suggested that participants expected the RBA to start cutting the cash rate from around late 2024 or early 2025, but at a more gradual pace than that expected in several other advanced economies. That was consistent with the fact that policy rates in most other advanced economies had been increased earlier and to more restrictive levels than in Australia, and that inflation appeared to be returning sustainably to target more quickly in those economies. Market expectations were nevertheless for the stance of monetary policy in those countries (as measured by gaps between the policy rate and central bank estimates of the neutral interest rate) to be more restrictive than in Australia until around late 2025. Financial stability assessment Members discussed the staffÂs semi-annual assessment of financial stability risks. In the context of an easing in inflation globally and an uncertain economic outlook, the staffÂs assessment was that vulnerabilities in the global financial system remain. Three vulnerabilities stood out as having the potential to affect financial stability in Australia significantly, namely: increased complexity and interconnectedness in the financial system, in part reflecting digitalisation and rapid technological development, had created operational vulnerabilities and central points of failure low market risk premia had raised the prospect of a disorderly adjustment in financial asset prices, including if expectations for a soft landing in the global economy were not realised and particularly in the context of rising government debt and the absence of medium-term fiscal frameworks longstanding vulnerabilities in the Chinese financial system â affecting banks, non-banks and local governments â had been exacerbated by the ongoing weakness in the Chinese real estate sector. Members observed the potential for global threats originating from outside the financial system, such as geopolitical risks and climate change, to interact with these vulnerabilities with adverse effects. For example, heightened geopolitical tensions had increased the prospect of cyber-attacks that could have systemic implications. Members noted that the RBA is working with market participants and the other agencies of the Council of Financial Regulators to strengthen the operational resilience of the Australian financial system. Domestically, members recognised that financial pressures from persistent inflation and restrictive monetary policy meant many households were having to make difficult adjustments to their spending and financial arrangements. At the same time, risks to the Australian financial system from lending to households and businesses remained contained. In part, that reflected the fact that banks had maintained prudent lending standards and built substantial capital over recent years, leaving them well positioned to continue supporting the economy through credit provision. But it also reflected the fact that the share of borrowers experiencing severe financial stress had remained small, with housing loan arrears having increased only gradually from low levels. The increase was greatest for highly leveraged borrowers, but these comprised a very small share of lending. Very few borrowers were in negative equity. Members observed that borrowersÂ resilience had been supported by prevailing savings buffers and the ongoing strength in the labour market. Most borrowers had maintained or added to their mortgage prepayment buffers over the preceding year; that said, there was a range of experiences and some borrowers were regularly drawing on their savings. High-income borrowers were the only group that in aggregate were running down their prepayment buffers, but their buffers remained large and were declining partly to fund discretionary consumption. Most borrowers were still likely to have spare cash flow under a range of plausible scenarios, including one in which there was a marked deterioration in the labour market. A more sustained reduction in inflation would also help to ease financial pressures. The strong financial position of most businesses prior to the slowing in the economy had supported their ability to navigate the recent period. Members noted that the sharp increase in business insolvencies â particularly for small businesses and in the hospitality sector â partly reflected a period of catch-up following the removal of pandemic-era support. The cumulative level of insolvencies was still below the pre-pandemic trend, and most insolvencies so far had involved small businesses with little debt, limiting the broader spillovers to lenders. The share of banksÂ business loans in arrears had remained low. Members discussed the expansion of business lending by non-banks, as favourable funding conditions had enabled them to claim market share from banks. While there was limited information about the quality of this lending, its small size limited systemic risks. Elsewhere in the non-bank sector, the significant growth of the superannuation sector had increased its importance to the smooth functioning of the financial system. While financial stability risks were limited by most funds having a defined contribution structure in which leverage was restricted, the growing size of the industry underscored the importance of maintaining strong liquidity risk management practices. Members agreed that financial stability concerns were not a constraint on monetary policy at the time of the meeting. However, looking ahead, they discussed the potential for financial sector vulnerabilities to build if easier financial conditions were to lead higher risk borrowers to take on excessive debt and/or lenders to compete more aggressively by lowering lending standards. Members noted the RBA ReviewÂs recommendation that decisions about monetary and macroprudential policy should be coordinated in such a situation. Review of the Term Funding Facility Members discussed the review of the Term Funding Facility (TFF), which was one component of the monetary policy package to support the Australian economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The review concluded that the TFF had met its policy goals, which were to: reinforce the benefits to the economy of a lower cash rate by reducing the funding costs of banks and, in turn, interest rates paid by borrowers; and encourage banks to support businesses during a difficult period. Members agreed that the TFF had contributed effectively to restoring confidence in financial markets, keeping credit flowing and stimulating aggregate demand. They agreed that a facility of this type should remain one of the policy options to be considered if future circumstances warranted the use of unconventional monetary policy. Members discussed the lessons from the experience with the TFF. They noted the importance of effective contingency planning ahead of considering the use of unconventional monetary policy tools, including ensuring operational readiness, effective risk management and appropriate governance. Members also observed the trade-offs that could be considered in the design of any future scheme. For instance, the fixed rate feature of the TFF was judged at the time to be important to ensure consistency with other elements of the monetary policy package deployed in response to the pandemic, despite bringing greater financial risk to the RBA. Nearly half of the financial losses stemming from the TFF were because of its extension in September 2020. Members discussed whether that decision was appropriate, given the information available at the time. They highlighted: the international evidence supporting the need for strong action when interest rates are near zero; the value of coordinating with fiscal responses in such circumstances; the extreme uncertainty about the impact of the virus on the economy and of the impending end of the JobKeeper scheme at the time; and the way the TFF reinforced other elements of the monetary policy package. On the other hand, the lack of drawdown by banks until close to the September 2020 deadline signalled that they might not have needed additional funding. In addition, the potential implications for the RBAÂs finances of the TFF extension had been subject to only limited stress testing. Members concluded that these observations emphasised the importance of considering a wide range of scenarios when making any future policy decisions involving unconventional monetary policy measures. The Board agreed to publish the review, which would be accompanied by a speech by the Assistant Governor (Financial Markets). Considerations for monetary policy Turning to considerations for the immediate policy decision, members noted that the information received since the previous meeting had been mixed. Taken together, the information had not materially altered their assessment of the economic outlook as of this meeting. Underlying inflation was still too high and, in quarterly terms, had fallen very little over the preceding year. Output growth remained weak: GDP growth in the June quarter had been in line with expectations but household consumption had been notably weaker than expected. The staff still judged it as likely that consumption growth would pick up alongside the expected recovery in real disposable income in the second half of the year. It was too soon to judge how rapidly this would occur, though higher frequency data suggested there was a risk that it could be delayed somewhat. Risks around the outlook for AustraliaÂs exports had shifted to the downside since the prior meeting. In part, this reflected a greater prospect of slower global output growth, given further increases in unemployment rates in some countries and the weakness in the Chinese economy. Members observed that services exports were also likely to be weaker than forecast in August because of the various policy measures relating to overseas student numbers. The implications of this for inflation were less clear though, given the potential offsetting implications for labour supply. Growth in employment had remained solid over prior months, including in comparison with other economies. The unemployment rate had risen gradually but conditions in the labour market still appeared to be tighter than those consistent with sustainable full employment. Members judged that the level of aggregate demand was still above the level of aggregate supply. Weak productivity growth was constraining the economyÂs potential growth rate. Financial conditions had eased over prior months, as cash rate expectations and bond yields declined and equity prices rose. Credit growth had picked up and banks were well placed to support the economy. Members observed that many households were experiencing financial pressure but only a small share of households and firms were not able to service their loans. The exchange rate had appreciated a little but, in trade-weighted terms, was within its range of recent years. Taken together, members felt that not enough had changed since the previous meeting to alter their assessment that the current level of the cash rate best balanced the risks to inflation and the labour market. They therefore agreed that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate target unchanged at this meeting. Looking ahead, members reiterated that the data and the evolving assessment of risks would guide their future decisions on what path of interest rates would bring inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe, while preserving the gains in the labour market. Members then discussed scenarios in which future monetary policy might need to be held restrictive for a prolonged period or tightened further. One of these was if consumption growth were to pick up materially in response to the recovery in real household disposable income that was likely to have begun around mid-year. If that were to occur, labour market outcomes could be stronger than forecast and inflation would return to target more slowly. Another was if the outlook for aggregate supply proved to be more constrained than currently expected â for instance, if the economyÂs current supply potential had been overestimated or if future productivity growth turned out to be weaker than assumed. Members also considered a formal analysis in which the economyÂs supply capacity was more limited than currently assumed. In this case, the cash rate might need to be noticeably higher than the market path underpinning the August forecasts, in order to bring inflation sustainably back to target by 2026. Members observed that monetary policy could need to be tightened, even if the BoardÂs judgements about consumption, the labour market and supply potential prove correct, should present financial conditions turn out to be insufficiently restrictive to return inflation to target. Members noted that the easing in financial conditions over prior months and the pick-up in credit growth made this scenario somewhat more plausible, as did the observation that banks were well placed to facilitate any strengthening in credit demand. On the other hand, members observed that there were scenarios in which future financial conditions might need to be less restrictive than they were at present. One such scenario was if the economy proved to be significantly weaker than expected and this placed more downward pressure on underlying inflation than expected. This could occur if households saved a significantly larger proportion of their incomes than currently assumed, perhaps because of earlier declines in real income and/or more persistent uncertainty. It could also occur if the labour market weakened more sharply than forecast. Another scenario was if inflation proved less persistent than assumed, even without weaker-than-expected activity. This could occur, for instance, if rent inflation fell more rapidly, falling petrol or other commodity prices materially reduced firmsÂ cost base or the decline in discretionary spending flowed through materially more quickly to services inflation. Members noted that each of these outcomes was conceivable given the considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook. Therefore, future financial conditions might need to be either tighter or looser than at present to achieve the BoardÂs objectives. Members agreed that, while it was important to take account of economic developments abroad, it was not necessary for the cash rate target to evolve in line with policy rates in other economies since Australian inflation was higher, the labour market stronger and monetary policy less restrictive than in many other advanced economies. The exchange rate could also adjust as interest rate differentials between Australia and other economies evolved. In finalising the BoardÂs statement, members agreed that it was important to convey that the Board remained vigilant to upside risks to inflation. They also affirmed that monetary policy would need to be sufficiently restrictive until members were confident that inflation was moving sustainably towards the target range and, based on the information available at the time of the meeting, that it was not possible to either rule in or rule out future changes in the cash rate target at this time. Members would rely upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide the BoardÂs decisions. Returning inflation to target remains the BoardÂs highest priority and it will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome.

2024-11-05,"Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board Hybrid â 4Â and 5Â November 2024 Members participating MicheleÂ Bullock (Governor and Chair), AndrewÂ Hauser (Deputy Governor), IanÂ HarperÂ AO, CarolynÂ HewsonÂ AO, StevenÂ KennedyÂ PSM, IainÂ RossÂ AO, ElanaÂ RubinÂ AM, CarolÂ SchwartzÂ AO, AlisonÂ WatkinsÂ AM Others participating SarahÂ Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), ChristopherÂ Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets) AnthonyÂ Dickman (Secretary), DavidÂ Norman (Deputy Secretary) MeredithÂ BeecheyÂ Osterholm (Future Hub), SallyÂ Cray (Chief Communications Officer), DavidÂ Jacobs (Head, Domestic Markets Department), MichaelÂ Plumb (Head, Economic Analysis Department), PenelopeÂ Smith (Head, International Department) International economic conditions Members began their discussion by noting that the central forecast for global economic growth had not changed significantly over the prior three months. Average GDP growth for AustraliaÂs major trading partners was expected to be moderate. Inflation had declined to be close to targets across most advanced economies, and many central banks had reduced the extent of policy restrictiveness as their attention began to shift to downside risks to activity, labour markets and inflation. Output growth in China had been weak recently, but the outlook had been upgraded following the announcement of a range of policy stimulus measures by Chinese authorities. This stimulus had also reduced some of the downside risks to growth in China, which members had discussed at previous meetings, though other downside risks remained. Financial asset prices in China had increased sharply in response to the announcement of the stimulus package. At the same time, the property market in China and property developersÂ balance sheets remained very weak. Along with weaker real income growth, this was weighing on the confidence of households in China and on housing credit growth there. Members considered various channels through which economic stimulus in China could support the Australian economy. They concluded that the implications for Australia could be more modest than in the past because the capacity of the mining sector to increase AustraliaÂs volume of mineral exports was limited. Moreover, it was unlikely that the sector would invest as heavily to expand this capacity as it had in the past, and the gains from any rise in the terms of trade were expected for the most part to be saved. Members considered various forward-looking factors that could affect the global economic outlook. One of these was the possibility of a marked change in US economic policy following the US presidential election, the outcome of which would be known after the meeting. Members noted that the effects of the candidatesÂ policy proposals were difficult to quantify and would also depend significantly on the outcome of the Congressional elections, the extent and speed of implementation, and on how other countries respond. A wide range of alternative outcomes was possible; some scenarios involved significantly lower global growth and increased inflationary pressures, but the implications of others for global growth were more uncertain. The implications for the Australian economy of the scenarios with limited global reaction could ultimately be quite modest because of the potential for trade flows to be redirected, as had been observed in the past. Members noted that, whatever the election outcome, US fiscal deficits were forecast to be large, making sovereign debt markets more sensitive to adverse shocks over time. Domestic economic conditions Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that GDP growth had been subdued in the June quarter but looked to have picked up since then. The staffÂs medium-term forecast for the level of GDP had been lowered slightly since August. Output growth was expected to pick up gradually to around its potential rate by late 2025. A range of higher frequency data tentatively suggested that household consumption growth (excluding the effect of energy rebates on measured household expenditure) had increased in the September quarter. However, that projected increase was a little less than forecast in August and followed a surprisingly weak outcome in the June quarter. Members discussed the signal for medium-term consumption outcomes that should be drawn from these indicators, along with insights from liaison on the experience of various retailers and the subdued level of consumer sentiment. The staff forecast was still for a sustained pick-up in household consumption from the second half of 2024, in response to rising real household incomes, but this was expected to occur a little later than had been anticipated in August. The outlook for services exports had been revised down significantly, reflecting the expected impact of tighter international student visa policies. However, this had not materially affected the staffÂs assessment of the gap between aggregate demand and aggregate supply because lower net overseas migration would also reduce the economyÂs supply capacity. Members noted the staffÂs judgement that the gap between aggregate demand and aggregate supply was still positive but had narrowed. It would become more difficult to have confidence that this gap was positive, however, as the economy and labour market move closer towards balance. Members assessed that labour market conditions remained tight relative to full employment. While conditions had continued to ease gradually, and the unemployment rate had drifted upwards as expected, employment growth had been strong and a number of indicators â including measures of underemployment, youth unemployment, job advertisements and surveys of labour availability â suggested that the easing in the labour market might have begun to stall or modestly reverse. Members contrasted these indicators with others, such as employment intentions, which had been more subdued. Against this backdrop, members noted that the risks of a rapid deterioration in labour market conditions might have diminished somewhat, though such a scenario could not be ruled out. The forecast was still for the unemployment rate to increase gradually before stabilising around levels consistent with full employment by late 2025. Members considered the implications of the contrast between subdued growth in output and continued strong growth in employment (which implied weak productivity growth). This disparity may partly have reflected a significant share of growth in employment over the prior year having been in non-market sectors, where the approach to measuring productivity means estimated growth is limited by definition. However, members observed that productivity outcomes in the market sector had also been weak by historical standards, especially in construction and mining. Some part of this was likely to be attributable to a decline in the capital-to-labour ratio, as investment has not kept pace with unexpectedly strong employment growth. Members considered the implications of these outcomes for the staffÂs long-run productivity growth assumption. They also discussed the interaction between future productivity outcomes and wages. Growth in wages and labour costs were forecast to moderate further to levels consistent with inflation being at target, but members noted that wages growth would need to slow even further to enable a return to the inflation target if productivity growth does not increase as assumed. Turning to inflation, headline CPI inflation had fallen sharply in the September quarter because of electricity rebates and declining fuel prices. Underlying inflation â which members agreed provides a better indicator of inflation momentum â had remained high (at 3.5Â perÂ cent) and was declining more slowly. Growth in advertised rents had slowed more than expected in preceding months, which would flow through to lower CPI rent inflation over time. Looking ahead, headline inflation was forecast to remain temporarily within the 2â3Â perÂ cent target range until the September quarter 2025, when the scheduled end to energy rebates would see it pick up. Inflation was not expected to return sustainably to the target until 2026, as the level of aggregate demand and aggregate supply move into better balance. Members noted that the outlook for underlying inflation was little changed since the August meeting, with services inflation projected to decline alongside further gradual easing in labour market conditions and an expectation that goods prices would continue to rise at a modest pace. Annual review of staff forecasts Members discussed the staffÂs annual forecast review and drew a number of lessons. In line with the forecasts published in the November 2023 Statement on Monetary Policy, underlying inflation and the unemployment rate had evolved largely as expected. However, underlying inflation outcomes over the prior two years had generally been higher than earlier forecasts and quarterly outcomes for underlying inflation since late 2023 had pointed to the relatively slow progress in reducing inflation. GDP growth had been significantly weaker than forecast a year earlier. That reflected weaker-than-anticipated growth in private demand, partly offset by stronger growth in public demand. Members noted that the staffÂs projections for public demand were based on budgeted expenditure by federal and state governments that had been announced at the time the forecasts were prepared. Taken together, the weaker GDP outcomes, persistence in underlying inflation and the rate of unemployment being broadly as forecast had suggested that the economyÂs supply capacity was less than projected a year earlier. This was consistent with weaker-than-expected measured labour productivity and had motivated the staff to revise downwards their assessment of full employment, as set out in the August 2024 Statement on Monetary Policy. Financial conditions Members commenced their discussion of financial conditions by noting that central banks in many advanced economies had reduced their policy rates over prior months and that further rate cuts were expected. Central banks had been responding to potential downside risks in labour market conditions and increased confidence that inflation was sustainably returning to central banksÂ targets. Members observed that policy interest rates in most other advanced economies were still assessed to be restrictive relative to those central banksÂ published estimates of neutral rates, and more restrictive than monetary policy in Australia. They discussed some of the factors that could cause estimates of neutral nominal interest rates to vary across countries â including differences in inflation targets and potential growth rates â and the weight to place on such estimates in policymaking. Looking ahead, market participants still expected that policy rates in most countries, including Australia, would approach estimated neutral levels by around the end of 2025. However, expectations for the path of policy rates in some advanced economies had shifted upwards since the September meeting, in response to indicators that had allayed concerns emerging in August that economic growth may be turning down sharply, especially for the United States. Longer term government bond yields in most advanced economies had also increased. This may have been driven in part by market perceptions that a Âsoft landingÂ scenario was increasingly likely, coupled with upward pressure on term premia and long-term market-based inflation compensation. Members discussed the extent to which these latter effects may have been associated with geopolitical tensions and the implications of potential changes to economic policies following the US elections. In many economies, yield curves had become upward sloping after a period of being inverted; by contrast, those in Australia and Japan had remained upward sloping over the preceding year. A range of other measures implied that global financial conditions had eased over prior months, as volatility had subsided and risk premia had declined. Corporate bond yields in the United States and Europe had declined to year-to-date lows, partly reflecting a narrowing of spreads to sovereign bonds. Prices of riskier assets had generally increased in advanced economies since early August. The rise in equity prices had been driven by an increase in expectations of future earnings in the United States and a decline in equity risk premia elsewhere. Members noted the potential for market volatility at some point following the US presidential election. Members judged that Australian financial conditions remained restrictive overall, although there had been a modest easing in some indicators over preceding months. Housing credit growth had risen further and business credit growth had remained above its long-run average. Members observed that this was somewhat unusual in a period of monetary policy tightness, and that it perhaps reflected banks being well positioned to continue supplying credit to the economy. However, they also noted that credit had not been rising as a share of nominal household disposable income (in the case of housing credit) or nominal GDP (in the case of business credit). Scheduled mortgage and consumer credit payments remained high but were no longer increasing as a share of nominal household disposable income. Market expectations for the path of the cash rate had risen since the September meeting, in response to signs of persistent strength in the labour market and expectations of somewhat less accommodative monetary policy in the United States. Market pricing suggested that participants now expected the Board to start reducing the cash rate target from around mid-2025, a few months later than at the time of the September meeting. Market economists also expected the first reduction in the cash rate target to occur in the first half of 2025. Members noted that market pricing and economistsÂ expectations were for a more gradual pace of rate cuts than expected in several other advanced economies. The Australian dollar trade-weighted index had continued to trade within the range observed since early 2022. An initial appreciation of the exchange rate from its recent low in August had been consistent with a rise in yield differentials between Australia and its major trading partners, and the announcement of a stimulus package in China. However, it was likely that the effect of these factors on the Australian dollar had been offset more recently by the implications of potential policy changes following the US elections, including the possibility that significant tariffs would be imposed on Chinese exports. Considerations for monetary policy Turning to considerations for the immediate policy decision, members noted that much of the information received since the September meeting had been consistent with expectations of the Board and staff, which had been broadly true at the time of the September meeting too. As a result, the staffÂs updated forecasts were very similar to those published in August. The risks surrounding the forecasts were also still judged to be balanced. Inflation had been declining over the prior year, driven most recently by lower fuel prices and the expected fall in electricity prices. However, members observed that underlying inflation â as indicated by the Âtrimmed meanÂ measure â remained too high and that the staff forecasts did not see inflation returning sustainably to target until 2026. Employment growth had been strong and some of the forward indicators of conditions in the labour market had stabilised or strengthened. However, GDP growth had remained subdued, largely reflecting weakness in private consumption. The staff forecast was for a strengthening in consumption growth to underpin a recovery in GDP growth to around estimates of the potential growth rate over the coming year, and for the unemployment rate to stabilise around the staffÂs estimates of full employment from late 2025. Monetary policy in Australia was assessed to be restrictive. However, the degree to which this was the case remained uncertain and broader financial conditions had eased somewhat over preceding months. Members noted that the staff forecasts were conditioned on a technical assumption â derived from market pricing â that the cash rate target would remain at its current level for a number of months before being lowered several times in 2025 and 2026. Members agreed that, based on these considerations, it was appropriate to leave the cash rate target unchanged at this meeting. The economy appeared to be evolving in line with earlier expectations, and the staff forecasts were consistent with the BoardÂs strategy of aiming to return inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe while preserving as many of the gains in the labour market as possible. Members observed that these outcomes were predicated on a technical assumption for the cash rate that did not incorporate any change in the near term. Taken together, these observations suggested that there was no immediate need to change the cash rate target. At the same time, members recognised it was important to be ready to adjust the future stance of monetary policy as the economic outlook evolves. Members therefore considered the conditions that might warrant either a future change in the cash rate target or a decision to hold it at its present level for a prolonged period. Members agreed that it was important to keep monetary policy sufficiently restrictive until the Board is confident that inflation is moving sustainably towards the target. They noted too that it is important to remain forward looking, avoiding an excessive reliance on backward-looking information that might lead the Board to react too late to a change in economic conditions. Members discussed a number of potential scenarios in which the key judgements underlying the forecasts proved incorrect, consequently warranting an adjustment in monetary policy. One set of scenarios centred around the judgement on consumption. Members agreed that if consumption proves to be persistently and materially weaker than the staff forecast, and this was judged likely to lower inflation significantly, a reduction in the cash rate target could be warranted. Members noted various reasons why consumption might be weaker: consumer sentiment, though higher than a year earlier, was still low by historical standards; and data available for the September quarter suggested there had not yet been a significant increase in consumption growth, even as household cash flows had been supported by the Stage 3Â tax cuts and energy rebates. At the same time, members highlighted that the current monetary policy setting might need to remain in place for longer than assumed if the recovery in consumption proved sharper than the forecast envisaged. They noted that such an outcome could occur in response to the increase in household wealth over preceding years, the emerging recovery in real household income and nascent signs of an upturn in consumer sentiment. More generally, members noted scenario modelling by staff in which materially stronger-than-expected demand placed greater upward pressure on underlying inflation, requiring the current policy setting to remain in place for an extended period. Members discussed scenarios in which the judgement about the labour market proved incorrect and conditions eased materially more sharply than expected, in turn lowering inflation more rapidly and warranting a looser monetary policy stance. This could occur if firms are currently hoarding labour and are prompted to unwind this stance in the future. Members recounted instances of firms either laying off staff or intending not to fill vacancies as they arise. Such trends were not yet widely apparent from the RBAÂs liaison with firms, but members observed that if forward-looking indicators began to suggest a widespread easing in prospective labour market conditions and a more rapid easing in inflation, the Board might need to consider a policy response. Members also considered scenarios in which it became evident that the supply capacity of the economy was materially more limited than assumed in the forecasts, necessitating a tighter monetary policy stance. Members observed that this could be the case if the staffÂs assessment of the economyÂs current potential growth rate was too optimistic or if productivity growth over coming years fell short of that assumed in the forecasts. They noted that persistent weakness in productivity growth would not only erode long-run real income growth but could also boost inflation over the forecast period if wages growth did not adjust in a sufficiently timely manner. More generally, members noted that, given the already lengthy period in which inflation had been above target, the Board has minimal tolerance to accommodate a more prolonged period of high inflation, even if this occurred because of factors that constrained the economyÂs supply capacity. However, there were also scenarios in which inflation declined materially more quickly than currently forecast, perhaps in response to emerging signs that rental housing markets in many cities were moving into better balance or because the energy rebates have a more pervasive effect than factored in (e.g. if they have a broader effect on inflation expectations or price indexation than staff expect). Members noted that this could warrant an easing in the cash rate target, but that they would need to observe more than one good quarterly inflation outcome to be confident that such a decline in inflation was sustainable. Members also discussed a range of particular risks from abroad that could result in the forecasts being materially wrong and therefore have important implications for monetary policy. These included the potential for major changes in US economic policy following the presidential election, the prospect of the size or composition of the stimulus package foreshadowed by Chinese authorities differing from expectations, and the more general risk of unsustainable growth in global government debt. Members agreed that it was not yet possible to factor in events such as these, given pertinent details were unknown and still largely unpredictable, but that this would need to be done if these risks eventuated. Finally, members noted that monetary policy might need to be adjusted if the Board formed the view that the stance of policy was not as restrictive as had been judged. They agreed that it was important to pay close attention to potential signs of this, including developments in credit growth, banksÂ willingness to lend and growth in asset prices. In finalising the BoardÂs statement, members agreed that it was important to convey that the Board remained vigilant to upside risks to inflation. They also affirmed that monetary policy would need to be sufficiently restrictive until members are confident that inflation is moving sustainably towards the target. Based on the information available at the time of the meeting, members agreed that it was not possible to rule anything in or out in relation to future changes in the cash rate target. Members would rely upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide the BoardÂs future decisions. Returning inflation to target remains the BoardÂs highest priority and it will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome.

2024-12-10,"Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board Hybrid â 9Â and 10Â December 2024 Members participating MicheleÂ Bullock (Governor and Chair), AndrewÂ Hauser (Deputy Governor), IanÂ HarperÂ AO, CarolynÂ HewsonÂ AO, StevenÂ KennedyÂ PSM, IainÂ RossÂ AO, ElanaÂ RubinÂ AM, CarolÂ SchwartzÂ AO, AlisonÂ WatkinsÂ AM Others participating SarahÂ Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), ChristopherÂ Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), DavidÂ Jacobs (Head, Domestic Markets Department) AnthonyÂ Dickman (Secretary), DavidÂ Norman (Deputy Secretary) MeredithÂ Beechey Osterholm (Head, Monetary Policy Strategy), SallyÂ Cray (Chief Communications Officer), MichaelÂ Plumb (Head, Economic Analysis Department) KeithÂ Drayton (Chief Risk Officer) for the item on the future system for monetary policy implementation, ChristopherÂ Thompson (Deputy Head, Payments Policy Department) for the item on the future of money and payments Financial conditions The Board began its discussions by noting that central banks in most advanced economies had cut policy rates over prior months as inflationary pressures had eased, and many had signalled further cuts. Despite this, monetary policy remained more restrictive in most peer economies than in Australia. Compared with views at the time of the previous meeting, market participants expected a slightly slower pace of rate cuts in the United States but a somewhat faster pace of cuts in the euro area. The central banks that had cut rates most aggressively â such as those in Canada, Sweden and New Zealand â were responding to particularly weak economic conditions, which included significant increases in unemployment rates. Financial markets had at the time of the meeting generally responded quite modestly to the results of the US presidential election. Government bond yields had risen in the months preceding the election, consistent with an expectation of somewhat higher inflation and government debt issuance irrespective of the outcome, but yields had subsequently declined. While the level of government debt for Australia was lower than for peer economies, domestic yields had been heavily influenced by global market conditions and had moved similarly. Since the election, equity prices had risen in the United States and most other advanced economies, including Australia. More generally, equity risk premia were at historically low levels in many markets, also including Australia. Members discussed potential explanations for the low equity risk premia, at a time when economic and policy uncertainty appeared high. In doing so, they noted the common trends in risk premia between the United States and Australia despite considerable differences in the composition of their equity markets. Members also considered the potential economic implications if equity risk premia proved to be unsustainably low. They noted that, to date, firms had not accelerated their pace of equity raising in public financial markets. The Australian dollar had depreciated against the USÂ dollar and, to a lesser extent, against a broader basket of currencies on a trade-weighted basis since the previous meeting. In part, these moves reflected broad-based strength in the USÂ dollar, though market participants had reported that they also reflect concerns about the outlook for the Chinese economy. These concerns had emerged despite Chinese authorities shifting to a more accommodative economic policy stance (of which full details had yet to be revealed). The staff continued to assess financial conditions in Australia as restrictive overall. Interest rates on bank lending were above their average since 2009, as were household debt repayments as a share of income. That said, conditions were not as tight as implied by the level of interest rates alone. The supply of finance had held up well overall, reflected in spreads to risk-free rates across swap, bond and bank lending markets that were below historical averages, and supported by still relatively low levels of loan arrears. Consistent with that, overall credit growth had picked up over the prior year. Within that, housing credit growth had increased to around its longer run average, which was somewhat unusual given developments in the cash rate over preceding years. Members noted the available evidence that the ability of households to borrow had been constrained by the tightening in monetary policy since 2022 and that the strength in housing credit growth might be partly explained by factors such as strong growth in the population and nominal income. Meanwhile, growth in credit to businesses had been above average, alongside resilient company earnings, which also provided an ongoing source of funding for business investment. Market expectations for the cash rate were a little lower than at the time of the previous meeting, after having risen noticeably over preceding months. Market participants expected a modest amount of easing in the cash rate to begin in the first half of 2025. The timing of this had been brought forward a little, following weaker-than-expected September quarter national accounts data. International economic conditions Members discussed the high level of uncertainty around the global economic outlook. Members were briefed on the various channels through which possible changes in US trade, fiscal, regulatory and immigration policies following the US election could affect growth and inflation globally and in Australia. While the policy direction of the new administration was becoming clearer, it was not yet possible to determine the net impact on the Australian economy without knowing details of the scale and nature of the policies to be implemented and how other economies would respond. Members also noted the relatively subdued level of economic activity in China (notwithstanding some recent strengthening) and the pronounced level of geopolitical uncertainty more generally. Members noted that inflation had continued to ease globally but that the extent and composition of disinflation had varied across economies. In particular, services price inflation was still proving persistent in several economies â a point that some central banks had noted might have implications for the speed at which they removed policy restrictiveness. Domestic economic conditions Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that output growth had been weak over the year to the September quarter, at 0.8Â perÂ cent. Quarterly growth had picked up modestly but by slightly less than had been expected in November. In addition, revisions to earlier data had raised the estimated level of output over prior years but had also implied slightly less momentum in growth than previously assessed. Growth in public demand had again accounted for most of the growth in GDP in the quarter, while there had been larger-than-expected subtractions from some of the more volatile components of GDP. Growth in both household income and consumption had recovered, but by a little less than had been expected (considering cost-of-living relief). More recent information pointed to a further pick-up in consumption in October and November, but it was too soon to judge whether this reflected a persistent pick-up or temporary pre-Christmas spending activity. Members noted that future trends in consumption spending would have important implications for the pace of GDP growth and the labour market. Members noted the staffÂs assessment that there was still excess demand in the Australian economy. This judgement was, however, becoming less clear as the estimated gap between aggregate supply and aggregate demand narrows. Measures of capacity utilisation from business surveys supported the assessment that there was still excess demand in the economy overall. On the other hand, members observed that trends in wages growth could be a signal that there was more capacity in the labour market than had been assumed. Labour market conditions had eased only gradually over the prior year and the earlier easing in some indicators had stalled. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1Â perÂ cent in October and had been broadly steady for some time, while the underemployment rate had declined a little since May. The employment-to-population ratio was well above historical norms, despite strong population growth, and was holding up significantly better than in many other economies. Members noted that employment growth had been driven by the non-market sector over preceding quarters. By contrast, growth in employment in the market sector had remained subdued, and survey and liaison measures of employment intentions â which mainly capture the market sector â had eased further. Members considered the implications of the differing pace of job creation in the market and non-market sectors. They agreed that the composition of growth in employment was not central for economic welfare or assessments of full employment. However, members noted the risk that growth in overall employment could stall if growth in the non-market sector were to slow more markedly than currently anticipated. The implications of this would depend on the extent to which prevailing trends in market sector employment reflected difficulties attracting workers when non-market sector demand was strong, or weak aggregate demand. Members discussed the latest information on wages growth. The Wage Price Index (WPI) had increased by 3.5Â perÂ cent over the year to the September quarter, down from 4.1Â perÂ cent in the preceding quarter. The step-down in growth was most pronounced for those whose wages were set by awards and enterprise bargaining agreements, reflecting the smaller increases in award wages this year and the absence of one-off administered wage increases. Growth in public sector wages had been slightly softer than expected in November, though there had been some volatility in preceding quarters; wages growth in individual agreements had been in line with expectations. Growth in nominal unit labour costs from the national accounts â a broader measure of labour costs than the WPI, which adjusts for labour productivity â had also eased further. Given the importance of productivity growth for sustainable wages growth and future living standards, members were briefed on the currently available information. Average labour productivity growth from 2017/18Â to 2023/24Â had been slow, at only 0.2Â perÂ cent per annum. Only a small part of the shortfall between this slow pace of growth in aggregate productivity and its historical average reflected the rising share of labour in the non-market sector. Productivity growth in the market sector had also been around a percentage point below long-run average rates and, at a more disaggregated level, there was a broad-based pattern of productivity growth in Australian industries having been below rates recorded by comparable industries in the United States (which had been experiencing stronger growth in productivity than elsewhere). While members noted that slow productivity growth over preceding years could be attributed to various temporary factors, it may also have been a continuation of the factors that had constrained productivity growth prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Members discussed the implications for inflation of persistently weak productivity growth. They noted that these would depend on whether aggregate demand and wages growth also slowed commensurately, thereby limiting inflationary pressures, or not. Inflation measured by the monthly CPI indicator had been unchanged at 2.1Â perÂ cent over the year to October. Members noted that the headline outcome continued to be reduced by the roll-out of electricity rebates and that the October data contained limited information about services price inflation. Inflation for rents and new dwelling costs had been slightly weaker than expected, pointing to modest downside risk to the staffÂs expectation for inflation in the December quarter. Members also discussed the modest easing in inflation indicators from business surveys and liaison. However, official measures of underlying inflation were around 3Â½Â perÂ cent, which was still some way from the 2.5Â perÂ cent midpoint of the inflation target. Considerations for monetary policy Turning to considerations for the monetary policy decision, members noted that much of the data received since the previous meeting had been broadly in line with the forecasts published in November; where differences had occurred, outcomes had, on balance, been somewhat softer. Taken together, these data had not been sufficient materially to alter the staffÂs central outlook for the economy, though they had shifted the risks surrounding the outlook. Underlying inflation was still too high, underpinned by persistently high services price inflation. The staffÂs most recent forecasts did not see inflation returning sustainably to the midpoint of the target until 2026. While recent information on inflation in housing services had been a little softer than expected, on its own this did not materially change the medium-term outlook for inflation. The information received since the previous meeting confirmed that wages growth had slowed and that this had occurred faster than expected. At the same time, recent productivity outcomes had remained weak. A number of indicators of labour market conditions had strengthened or stabilised over preceding months. However, employment growth in the market sector had been weak and hiring intentions in the private sector were below average. Growth in GDP had continued to be subdued in the September quarter and had been a little softer than expected. Revisions to historical data had resulted in the level of economic activity being higher than previously assumed but the momentum in growth somewhat weaker. Household consumption had picked up somewhat in the September quarter and early indications were that consumer spending had risen further in October and November. However, the extent to which this reflected a sustained recovery in consumer demand, rather than a pull-forward in expenditure in response to emerging patterns of promotional activity, was not clear. Members judged that financial conditions remained restrictive. However, lower-than-typical spreads, including on corporate bonds and bank lending, as well as a very low equity risk premium, suggested that financial conditions were less restrictive than implied by the cash rate alone. Members acknowledged that this observation could have implications for the appropriate stance of monetary policy. After careful consideration of these factors, members agreed that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate target unchanged at this meeting. They noted that the data received since the previous meeting had not been sufficient to shift the central forecast for inflation or the labour market materially at this stage. Members judged that economic developments remained consistent with the BoardÂs strategy of returning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe while preserving as many of the gains in employment as possible. They also observed that important additional information on the labour market, inflation and expenditure, along with a revised set of staff forecasts, would be available by the time of the February 2025 meeting. Turning to considerations for future decisions on the stance of monetary policy, members observed that the annual review of forecasts discussed at the previous meeting had shown underlying inflation and the unemployment rate evolving largely as expected in the November 2023 Statement on Monetary Policy. Members also observed that this had supported their confidence that inflation would sustainably return to target within the timeframe indicated by the staffÂs central forecasts. Relative to this central path, members judged that the risk that inflation returns to target more slowly than forecast had diminished since the previous meeting and that the downside risks to activity had strengthened. A consideration underpinning this judgement was reduced momentum in GDP growth over the year to the September quarter. Members noted that consumption growth had been weaker than expected over this period and that it was not clear whether the apparent strengthening in consumer spending in October and November would be sustained. Given the weakness in private demand and the slow pace of job creation in the market sector, members were alert to the risk that the unemployment rate could increase by more than expected if labour demand in the non-market sector were to slow abruptly. A second consideration was developments in wages growth, which had slowed by more than expected. Members discussed whether this could signal that potential labour supply was more abundant than had been assumed. They noted that it was possible for wages growth to slow even when employment was above its full employment level, so long as the labour market was moving towards better balance and inflation expectations remained anchored. They also discussed the possibility that the slowing was in response to earlier weakness in productivity growth, noting that growth in unit labour costs had also declined from its previously rapid rate. While members judged the upside risks to inflation to have diminished, they discussed several factors that meant it was too soon to conclude with full confidence that inflation was moving sustainably towards target. First, some of the data had indicated resilience in economic activity. A variety of labour market indicators could be signalling that progress in the labour market moving closer to its full employment level had stalled. Early indications from the ÂBlack FridayÂ sales also pointed to strength in consumer demand during that period. Services price inflation globally had been more persistent than expected and this could also prove to be the case in Australia. And members noted that various risks to the global economic outlook could, in some scenarios, limit the pace of further disinflation. Second, members noted uncertainties over the level of policy restrictiveness. A number of measures of financial conditions had loosened somewhat over prior months and there were indications that financial conditions were not restraining credit growth as much as had been expected. More generally, members observed that the cash rate was still below or comparable to the level of policy rates in several other economies, even as central banks in those economies had been lowering their policy rates. Despite the reductions abroad, the combination of market pricing and central banksÂ estimates of neutral interest rates implied that monetary policy might be more contractionary in several economies than in Australia and remain so into 2025. In weighing up the potential implications of these observations for future decisions on the stance of monetary policy, members reiterated their earlier view that they had minimal tolerance to accommodate a more prolonged period of high inflation than currently envisaged. At the same time, if the future flow of data continued to evolve in line with, or weaker than, their expectations, it would further increase their confidence that inflation was declining sustainably towards target. If that were to occur, members concluded that it would, in due course, be appropriate to begin relaxing the degree of monetary policy tightness. If the data came in stronger, that process could take longer. They noted that, in making this decision, they would be guided by how the evolving data shaped the economic outlook and the associated risks. In finalising the BoardÂs statement, members affirmed that monetary policy would need to be sufficiently restrictive until members are confident that inflation is moving sustainably towards target. They agreed that they had gained confidence about this since the previous meeting but risks remained. Members emphasised the need to be guided by the incoming data and evolving assessment of risks when making future decisions. Returning inflation to target remains the BoardÂs highest priority and it will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome. The decision The Board decided to leave the cash rate target unchanged at 4.35Â perÂ cent, and the interest rate on Exchange Settlement balances unchanged at 4.25Â perÂ cent. Future system for monetary policy implementation Members discussed the design of an ample reserves system with full allotment for implementing monetary policy, following an initial discussion in November. These discussions followed the BoardÂs decision earlier in the year to endorse a new operational framework for implementing monetary policy. In this system, banksÂ demands for reserves would be satisfied via open market repo operations, at a price near the cash rate target in Âfull allotment repurchase (repo) auctionsÂ. The staff had engaged with stakeholders via a public consultation and had undertaken detailed work to estimate the extent of demand for reserves and the potential operation of the system. The supply of reserves had declined significantly with the maturity of the Term Funding Facility and would continue to decline gradually as the RBAÂs bond holdings matured. At some stage the supply of reserves in the banking system would approach the level of underlying demand. Members agreed that the BoardÂs objective for the monetary policy implementation framework was to achieve Âmonetary controlÂ. This would involve the cash rate trading close enough to the target to convey a clear and consistent stance of monetary policy and to help anchor other short-term interest rates at levels broadly consistent with the cash rate. The Board agreed that effective monetary control could be achieved with modest deviations of the cash rate from the target. This would enable and encourage banks to use private financial markets to trade reserves and avoid the RBA having an overly large presence in markets. Well-functioning private financial markets provide resilient and diverse funding sources to banks and are therefore important for financial stability. In addition, this approach would allow the RBA to keep its financial and operational risk no larger than necessary to achieve the objectives of monetary control and encourage private market activity. In considering the appropriate degree of monetary control, members were informed of how the RBA could implement the ample reserves system to achieve its objectives. This included settings for administered rates and other terms of the RBAÂs market operations, along with a variety of means to supply reserves (including foreign exchange swaps, cross-currency swaps and purchases of short-dated government bonds). Members emphasised that decisions related to the implementation of the ample reserves system were operational and had no implications for the stance of monetary policy or the BoardÂs approach to bond holdings acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic. The RBA would continue monitoring how conditions in markets evolved as the quantity of reserves declined and adjust operational parameters over time within the bounds of the agreed approach. Members agreed that further details of the new framework should be publicised in due course, including via a speech by the Assistant Governor, Financial Markets in early 2025. The future of money and payments Members discussed a paper on the RBAÂs research on a central bank digital currency (CBDC), including the forward work agenda. They noted the staffÂs current assessment that a public interest case to issue a retail CBDC in Australia had yet to emerge. Australians are generally well served by a retail payments system that is safe and efficient and where there had been significant innovation over preceding decades. Moreover, while the use of physical cash for payments has been declining, the RBA and the Australian Government remain committed to ensuring that cash remains readily available for Australians who value using it. Members noted that there was greater scope to explore the advantages and disadvantages of a so-called wholesale CBDC, which could offer functionality that goes beyond the RBAÂs existing arrangements for providing Exchange Settlement Accounts to financial institutions. A key focus of current research at the RBA is on opportunities for a wholesale CBDC and associated infrastructure to support settlement in tokenised asset markets and enhance cross-border payments. The RBA had recently commenced a collaborative research project with industry â Project Acacia â to better understand how innovations in digital money could support tokenised asset settlement. The project is expected to be completed around the end of 2025. Members discussed some of the important policy challenges that issuance of some form of CBDC could pose, depending on its design and use. These include potential effects on the setting and implementation of monetary policy and on the RBAÂs balance sheet. Financial stability risks could also arise if a CBDC amplified bank runs in times of stress. These matters will require further research and engagement with the Monetary Policy Board in due course, if the case for a CBDC â wholesale or otherwise â becomes more compelling.

2025-02-18,"Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board Sydney â 17Â and 18Â February 2025 Members present MicheleÂ Bullock (Governor and Chair), AndrewÂ Hauser (Deputy Governor), IanÂ HarperÂ AO, CarolynÂ HewsonÂ AO, StevenÂ KennedyÂ PSM, IainÂ RossÂ AO, ElanaÂ RubinÂ AM, CarolÂ SchwartzÂ AO, AlisonÂ WatkinsÂ AM Others present SarahÂ Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), ChristopherÂ Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets) AnthonyÂ Dickman (Secretary), DavidÂ Norman (Deputy Secretary) MeredithÂ Beechey Osterholm (Head, Monetary Policy Strategy), SallyÂ Cray (Chief Communications Officer), DavidÂ Jacobs (Head, Domestic Markets Department), MichaelÂ Plumb (Head, Economic Analysis Department), PennyÂ Smith (Head, International Department) Financial conditions Members commenced their discussion of financial conditions by noting that central banks in most advanced economies had cut policy interest rates further in response to easing inflationary pressures and weaker labour market conditions. Many of these central banks had signalled that additional rate cuts were also likely. However, market expectations of the number of further cuts in the United States had declined somewhat, reflecting stronger-than-expected economic data, communication by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) about the balance of risks, the prospect of increased US fiscal stimulus and the anticipated inflationary impact of tariffs. Sovereign bond yields in advanced economies had tended to drift higher since the start of the year. For the United States and Japan, this reflected rising inflation expectations and a higher expected path for policy interest rates. Projections for ongoing growth in public debt were also placing upward pressure on sovereign yields in the United States, the United Kingdom and parts of Europe. Equity prices had risen since the US presidential election in most advanced economies, including Australia, and measures of equity risk premia remained very low. In the United States, this appeared to reflect stronger macroeconomic outcomes and expectations, following the US election, of lower corporate taxes and reduced regulation. Recent profit outcomes internationally had also been generally favourable. Outside of the United States, the anticipated impact of tariffs on company earnings had been partly offset by the associated appreciation of the USÂ dollar, which increased the local currency earnings of non-US exporters and multinational companies. In China, authorities had communicated that monetary and fiscal policy settings would be loosened further in 2025 to support economic growth objectives, against the backdrop of a potentially sustained increase in US tariffs. Longer term Chinese Government bond yields had declined to around historical lows, amid strong demand for bonds and persistently low inflation. Equity prices had been little changed in China after increasing in late 2024 following the announcement of stimulus measures. The renminbi had depreciated only slightly following the announcement of US tariffs, as Chinese authorities continued to lean against exchange rate depreciation. For Australia, the staff continued to assess financial conditions as restrictive overall. Interest rates on household and business lending were above their average since 2009, household debt repayments were high as a share of income, and growth in private activity was subdued. Estimates of the neutral interest rate are inherently uncertain and different modelling approaches used by the staff suggested a wide range of alternative values; all these lay below the cash rate, even before downward revisions to some of the staff estimates. In light of this pervasive uncertainty, members agreed that these revisions did not change their view about the stance of monetary policy, namely, that it remained restrictive. Market participants had brought forward their expectations of an easing in monetary policy, and now saw a high likelihood that the cash rate would be reduced by 25Â basis points at this meeting. The BoardÂs communication following the December meeting and the flow of data since then, including lower-than-expected outcomes for inflation and growth in GDP, had all been influential in moving market expectations for the current meeting. Market pricing continued to imply three or four 25Â basis point cuts by mid-2026. Although financial conditions remained restrictive overall, expectations for an early decline in the cash rate had contributed to some recent easing. Housing and business credit growth had increased further, wholesale funding conditions remained favourable and equity valuations were high. Members noted that the apparent strength in credit growth was partly explained by nominal growth in the economy. Indeed, household credit had declined relative to income and indicators of business gearing remained low. The Australian dollar had depreciated since November 2024, by 4Â perÂ cent against the USÂ dollar and 2Â perÂ cent on a trade-weighted basis. In trade-weighted terms, the Australian dollar was at the bottom of the trading range seen over the prior four years. The depreciation reflected broad-based USÂ dollar strength associated with the prospect of tariffs, a decline in yield differentials between Australia and major advanced economies, and ongoing uncertainty around the outlook for the Chinese economy. Members noted that the impact of a deprecation of the Australian dollar on domestic inflation depended on its cause. For example, an exchange rate depreciation is less likely to result in higher inflation if it is associated with a decline in the terms of trade or a significant downgrade of the global growth outlook. International economic conditions Uncertainty about the global economic outlook remained high, given evolving developments in US Government policies relating to trade, the fiscal position, deregulation and immigration. Members discussed the potential impact on global growth of the announced higher tariffs on imports to the United States and the early responses by other major economies. They judged that the uncertainty about policy settings was likely to weigh on business investment, and perhaps household consumption, until the situation becomes clearer. Output growth in the United States had remained robust towards the end of 2024 and timely indicators pointed to continued strong growth in the near term. US labour market conditions appeared to have stabilised at a level consistent with the FedÂs assessment of full employment, and earlier downside risks to the labour market had diminished. By contrast, growth in some other advanced economies remained subdued, and more so than had been expected. Inflation had continued to ease in most advanced economies, but the imposition of tariffs could potentially undo some of the progress on disinflation â particularly in the United States. China achieved its 5Â perÂ cent GDP growth target in 2024, with growth picking up towards the end of the year. Some part of this pick-up was judged to be temporary, relating to government subsidies for consumer durable goods in China and strong exports ahead of anticipated US tariffs. Chinese authorities had announced additional fiscal measures to boost consumption, with further support measures expected. While conditions in the Chinese housing market had improved, overall conditions remained weak and a sustained recovery still faced headwinds. Members noted that the ongoing uncertainty around US Government policy settings meant that Consensus global growth forecasts had not yet changed materially. Accordingly, the central forecast for growth in AustraliaÂs major trading partners was unchanged for 2025. The outlook for 2026 was slightly lower, however, reflecting a softer growth outlook for North America (owing to the prospects of higher tariffs in the region). Members noted the potential for global trade tensions to escalate, in which case these forecasts could change quickly and significantly. Domestic economic conditions Turning to the domestic economy, members noted that data on output, inflation and wages had been a little weaker than expected at the time of the November meeting, while data on the labour market had been stronger. Members considered the staffÂs judgement that the easing in labour market conditions since late 2022 had at least stalled and may even have reversed a little in late 2024. The unemployment rate had unexpectedly edged lower in the December quarter to be around the same level as in mid-2024, and the underemployment rate had declined noticeably. Employment growth had remained strong and a range of leading indicators of the labour market also signalled ongoing strength. Employment growth in the non-market sector continued to be very strong, most notably in health care. Members discussed analysis by the staff that suggested growth in health care employment had been achieved in part by drawing in workers from other industries, not only those who had previously been unemployed or not been in the labour force. Members observed that strong demand for labour in this sector had not resulted in greater dispersion of wages growth, because the movement of labour across industries had alleviated wages pressures in health care while reducing labour supply in industries where broader demand conditions were more subdued. In turn, this had likely contributed to relatively tight labour market conditions more broadly. Wages growth had remained steady over 2024 in quarterly terms, though it had eased in year-ended terms. Public sector wages growth had been volatile in preceding quarters â and further volatility was possible in coming quarters pending the timing of some large enterprise agreements â but continued to show underlying strength. Unit labour cost growth had also eased but was still higher than consistent with inflation being sustainably at target. Members welcomed the further easing in underlying inflation in the December quarter. Trimmed mean inflation was 0.5Â perÂ cent in the quarter and 3.2Â perÂ cent over the year; on a six-month annualised basis it had fallen to 2.7Â perÂ cent. There had been a broad-based easing in sub-components of the index. New dwelling cost inflation had eased considerably and unexpectedly owing to builders offering discounts. Inflation in rents had also continued to ease; this was partly due to an increase in the average number of people per household, which had alleviated some of the tightness in the rental market. Inflation in the price of a number of consumer services â including insurance â had declined, though services inflation overall remained high because of ongoing cost pressures. A wide range of transitory falls in various other components, mostly due to increased government subsidies, had collectively and temporarily lowered underlying inflation a little in the quarter. Headline inflation had eased to 2.4Â perÂ cent, and remained lower than underlying inflation, in part because of the effect of government subsidies to households. In light of these developments, members considered the staffÂs assessment that overall conditions in the labour market remained tight. That judgement reflected the relatively low rates of unemployment and underemployment, the recent increase in the stock of job vacancies, high growth in labour costs and reports from firms across a range of industries (via both business surveys and liaison) of ongoing difficulties finding suitable labour. At the same time, there had been an earlier-than-expected moderation in wages growth and underlying inflation. Members then discussed staff analysis of a range of possible factors that could mean labour market conditions might not be as tight as implied by the central forecasts. Among other things, this included the possibility that factors unrelated to labour market tightness â such as workersÂ attempts to restore real wages after the material reduction following the surge in inflation â or challenges measuring productivity in the non-market sector might be contributing to an over-assessment of the extent of tightness in the labour market. Members also considered whether the recent easing in inflation at a time of subdued growth in activity was attributable to some firmsÂ profit margins being compressed (as had been reported in liaison with firms) or to capacity pressures having eased in specific parts of the economy (such as the housing market). Some weight had been put on these arguments in the central projection, pushing down a little on the inflation forecast. However, it was possible that these effects could prove somewhat larger. Members noted that GDP growth over the year to the September quarter had remained well below estimates of potential growth, consistent with a further narrowing of the output gap. However, timely indicators were implying that growth may have picked up in late 2024 and this recovery was expected to continue over the coming year. As a result, the staffÂs judgement was that GDP growth would return to its potential growth rate and that the output gap was therefore unlikely to narrow much further, although the range of uncertainty around this judgement was material. These forecasts embodied a gradual pick-up in productivity growth to around its longer run average, following weak outcomes over preceding years. The unemployment rate was now expected to rise to around 4Â¼Â perÂ cent, lower than expected in November, before stabilising. Members noted that the forecasts were conditioned on market expectations for a cumulative 90Â basis points of reductions in the cash rate over the forecast period. The outlook for household consumption was a key factor underlying the projected recovery in GDP growth. Partial indicators suggested that consumption growth (excluding the effect of energy rebates) may have picked up a little further in late 2024, although it was unclear how much of this related to the increased prevalence of discounting and sales events. More generally, consumption growth was expected to recover alongside growth in real household disposable incomes, although a bit slower than had been expected in November. Members noted that there were credible arguments to suggest that consumption could be either weaker or stronger than the staff forecast. Looking beyond consumption, public demand had continued to support growth in overall activity and the outlook for public demand had been revised up, in line with the mid-year budget reviews by the Australian Government and state and territory governments. Underlying inflation was forecast to return to the 2â3Â perÂ cent range earlier than previously expected. The staff had taken some signal from the weaker-than-expected December quarter inflation outcome, although quarterly underlying inflation was expected to pick up in early 2025, in part owing to the unwinding of some temporary factors. However, underlying inflation was forecast to settle a little above the midpoint of the 2â3Â perÂ cent range from late 2025, assuming the cash rate followed the implied market path conditioning the forecasts. Members noted that this forecast was underpinned by the staffÂs judgement that labour market conditions would remain tight into the future if the cash rate followed this market-implied path, sustaining some upward pressure on inflation. Based on this forecast for underlying inflation, headline inflation was expected to exceed 3Â perÂ cent temporarily owing to the scheduled unwinding of cost-of-living measures. Members discussed potential risks to the forecasts identified by the staff. One related to the possibility that the extent of excess demand in the labour market had been overestimated, as discussed earlier. Another related to uncertainties over US Government policy. Members noted the staffÂs stylised scenarios that combined different assumptions of output growth of AustraliaÂs trading partners, shifts in global trade patterns, the impact of high uncertainty on investment and household spending, and financial linkages such as movements in the exchange rate. All the scenarios indicated that the effect on domestic growth would be negative to some degree, but it was less clear whether the effect on inflation would be positive or negative. Considerations for monetary policy Turning to considerations for the monetary policy decision, members noted that inflation had declined, and by more than had been expected, while wages growth had slowed. Output growth had remained subdued, reflecting weak growth in private demand over the prior year amid restrictive financial conditions. At the same time, underlying inflation remained above the midpoint of the 2â3Â perÂ cent range. Output was most likely a little above its potential level and the labour market was still judged to be tight; there had also continued to be very strong growth in employment and a decline in measures of underemployment. Consumption growth looked to have picked up in the December quarter, as expected. Given these factors, underlying inflation was expected to be a little lower in the near term than had been forecast in November, but it was then forecast to remain above the midpoint of the target range if the cash rate were changed in line with market expectations. In light of these developments, members considered their decision on the cash rate. Leaving the cash rate unchanged at this meeting could be appropriate if members formed the view that labour market conditions were still tighter than consistent with sustaining inflation at target, that the upside risks to inflation were still material or that a cut in the cash rate would not leave monetary policy sufficiently restrictive. Members noted that placing significant weight on any of these arguments could imply that it would be best to wait for additional data before deciding to adjust the cash rate. Conditions in the labour market provided the strongest reason to leave the cash rate unchanged. Members noted that a broad range of labour market indicators had strengthened over prior months and that the staff had lowered their forecast for the unemployment rate. They observed that there was a possibility that conditions in the labour market could prove even stronger than assumed in the staffÂs forecasts. Members noted that, while there was significant uncertainty about the extent of excess demand in the economy, the staffÂs judgement was that the tightness in the labour market was not consistent with inflation being at the target. A second argument to hold the cash rate steady related to the possibility that growth might pick up more quickly than forecast. That might come from household consumption, given the nascent recovery in real incomes and the aggregate financial position of the household sector. Or it might come from stronger global growth, if recent trends in equity markets were correct in implying that any adverse impact on growth of evolving US Government policy might not be material. Against this backdrop, members noted that the output gap was judged to be positive and unlikely to close over the forecast period if the cash rate followed the market path. A third potential reason for leaving the cash rate unchanged could be if members formed the view that the stance of monetary policy would not be sufficiently restrictive following a cut in the cash rate. Members noted that while there were various indicators underpinning the staffÂs judgement that current policy was restrictive, the signal from some other indicators (including credit growth, and equity and corporate bond market pricing) clouded this conclusion somewhat. The Australian dollar had also depreciated a little over preceding months. Members observed that not having lifted interest rates as high as in countries that had faced a similar inflation challenge meant the Board should be cautious when deciding to lower the cash rate. By contrast, reducing the cash rate at this meeting would be appropriate if members judged that their confidence that inflation could sustainably be returned to target had risen, if they placed greater weight on the downside risks to the economy than on those to the upside, or if the risk of leaving interest rates at current levels for too long was assessed to be greater than the risk of easing policy too soon. The strongest reason to lower the cash rate at this meeting was based on the signal from recent trends in inflation and wages. Members noted that inflation in the December quarter had been weaker than expected: indeed, underlying inflation was already close to the midpoint of the target range on a six-month annualised basis. The composition of inflation â with house-building costs having fallen and the pace of increase in rents and insurance premiums moderating â had also been favourable. Wages growth had been a little softer than expected, and the prospect that it would pick up had perhaps diminished given inflation had declined and if firms and workers were adjusting to weaker productivity growth. These developments could also be taken to imply that there was possibly more capacity in the labour market than members had previously judged. Members debated the range of explanations reviewed by staff that could be consistent with this. These included the possibility that a reasonable portion of the growth in wages over the prior year was attributable to real wage catch-up, or that productivity growth in the non-market sector had been higher than the official measure. The case to lower the cash rate at this meeting could be further supported if members assessed that the risks surrounding the outlook for economic growth were, on balance, to the downside. In the domestic economy, members considered it unlikely that employment in the non-market sector would continue to grow as strongly over the forecast period as it had done over the preceding year, and noted that any slowing would weigh on overall employment unless hiring in the market sector strengthened. The recovery in consumption was also not yet assured, given uncertainty about how much the December quarter data had been influenced by discounting or promotional activity and the risk that earlier falls in real household disposable income would exert a persistent drag. Consistent with that, some firms had recorded a narrowing in their profit margins. Internationally, uncertainty about US Government policy was high and members noted that this could have a material adverse effect on the propensity of firms and possibly also households to spend. Activity in the Chinese economy was also expected to slow. Having weighed up these alternative arguments, members decided that the case to lower the cash rate target at this meeting was, on balance, the stronger one. Members judged that the continued fall in underlying inflation, and at a somewhat faster pace than expected, meant that the upside risks to inflation had abated enough that they no longer needed the insurance they had taken out when raising the cash rate target in November 2023. Members tended to place more weight on the downside risks to the economy, and on the possibility identified by the staff that capacity in the labour market might be somewhat greater than embodied in the central projection. Given these judgements, members were particularly mindful of the risk of keeping monetary policy tight for too long, with adverse impacts on economic activity, the labour market and inflation. In taking this decision, members considered the risk that easing policy too soon could add to inflationary pressures. They observed that the central forecast for inflation to settle a little above the midpoint of the 2â3Â perÂ cent target range over the medium term was predicated on three to four reductions in the cash rate target over the year or so ahead. An alternative projection, in which the cash rate was left at 4.35Â perÂ cent for an extended period, showed underlying inflation undershooting the midpoint of the target range over the medium term. Members noted that both projections were subject to material uncertainty. But if the evolving data signalled that inflation was proving more persistent than expected, it would be reasonable to maintain a more restrictive stance of policy by holding the cash rate at 4.1Â perÂ cent for an extended period â given membersÂ assessment that this level would still be restrictive â or by even tightening policy if the outlook was for inflation to rise materially. On balance, members judged that accepting the risk of needing to adopt such a course of action was preferable to accepting the risk of holding interest rates high for too long. In light of these considerations about the risks surrounding the BoardÂs decision, members agreed that their decision at this meeting did not commit them to further reductions in the cash rate target at subsequent meetings. While economic outcomes had given members more confidence that they could return inflation to target at the same time as preserving most of the gains in the labour market with a lower cash rate, they agreed that this was not yet assured. As a result, members expressed caution about the prospect of further policy easing, which could also be seen in the forecast for inflation based on the market path. Members distinguished their current situation from that faced by central banks in other countries that had lowered interest rates several times. They noted that interest rates in Australia had not risen as high as elsewhere and that the labour market domestically was in a much stronger position than had been the case in other economies when their central banks first lowered interest rates. In finalising the policy statement, members affirmed their commitment to returning inflation to the midpoint of the target range, consistent with the BoardÂs mandate set out in the Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. They emphasised that the decision at this meeting acknowledged the progress that had been made in reducing inflation while not committing the Board to ease policy further. Members also agreed that future decisions would be guided by the incoming data and evolving assessment of risks. Returning inflation to target remains the BoardÂs highest priority and it will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome. The decision The Board decided to reduce the cash rate target by 25Â basis points to 4.10Â perÂ cent and to decrease the interest rate on Exchange Settlement balances by 25Â basis points to 4.00Â perÂ cent.

2025-04-01,"Minutes of the Monetary Policy Board Meeting Sydney â 31Â March and 1Â April 2025 Members present MicheleÂ Bullock (Governor and Chair), AndrewÂ Hauser (Deputy Governor and Deputy Chair), MarnieÂ Baker, RenÃ©eÂ Fry-McKibbin, IanÂ HarperÂ AO, CarolynÂ HewsonÂ AO, StevenÂ KennedyÂ PSM, IainÂ RossÂ AO, AlisonÂ WatkinsÂ AM Others present SarahÂ Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), BradÂ Jones (Assistant Governor, Financial System), ChristopherÂ Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets) AnthonyÂ Dickman (Secretary), DavidÂ Norman (Deputy Secretary) MeredithÂ BeecheyÂ Osterholm (Head, Monetary Policy Strategy), AndreaÂ Brischetto (Head, Financial Stability Department), SallyÂ Cray (Chief Communications Officer), DavidÂ Jacobs (Head, Domestic Markets Department), MichaelÂ Plumb (Head, Economic Analysis Department), PenelopeÂ Smith (Head, International Department), ClaudiaÂ Seibold (Senior Manager, Domestic Markets Department, for the discussion of ÂAssessing the RBAÂs government bond holdingsÂ) First meeting The Governor welcomed members to the inaugural meeting of the Monetary Policy Board. Financial conditions Members began their discussion of financial conditions by reviewing central bank policy rates in advanced economies. All central banks had acknowledged the heightened and ongoing uncertainty surrounding both the scope and potential impact of US trade policies. Members noted that expectations for policy rates in the United States and Canada had eased over prior months. Central banks in both countries had communicated downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation from US tariffs, though the US Federal ReserveÂs central expectation was for the effect on domestic inflation to be transitory. The lower expected path for US policy rates also reflected reduced market expectations of stimulatory fiscal policies and some softer-than-expected economic data. In other major economies, financial market expectations for central bank policy rates had been more stable. In Europe, expectations of substantial fiscal stimulus â driven by an anticipated increase in defence spending and a relaxation of fiscal rules â had tempered expectations for further policy rate cuts. Expectations that the Bank of JapanÂs policy rate would be increased had risen in response to stronger-than-expected wages data and broader expectations that inflationary pressures in Japan are likely to be sustained. In Australia, market participantsÂ expectations for the path of the cash rate had shifted a little higher in the near term, in response to communication following the February monetary policy meeting, but expectations had declined further out in response to international developments. Members noted that market pricing at the time was for further cuts in the cash rate totalling 50-75Â basis points by the end of 2025 â with little-to-no probability of a cut at the present meeting and around a 65Â perÂ cent probability of a cut in May. The cash rate path expected by market economists was a little higher than that reflected in market pricing. Members discussed possible explanations for this, including that market pricing incorporated some probability of very adverse outcomes associated with a marked escalation in trade tensions. Longer term sovereign bond yields in advanced economies had drifted lower in the United States and Canada but had risen slightly in Europe and Japan, in part reflecting the different shifts in expectations for central bank policy in those economies. In the United States, market-implied measures of inflation expectations derived from bond yields had increased at the two-year horizon but remained largely unchanged at longer horizons, suggesting that market participants expected the announced tariffs would not have persistent effects on US inflation. Outside of North America, market measures of inflation expectations were little changed, including in Australia. Turning to conditions in corporate funding markets, members noted that equity prices in the United States had fallen by almost 10Â perÂ cent from their peak as risk sentiment had deteriorated and the outlook for the US economy had weakened. By contrast, European equity prices had risen by more than 10Â perÂ cent since November, in response to expectations of greater defence and infrastructure spending and increased hopes of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Equity prices had declined in Australia by less than in the United States but by a similar amount to other small open economies that were particularly exposed to declines in global trade. Members noted that despite these recent movements, measures of compensation for risk in equity and corporate bond markets remained very low in all advanced economies. An important question was whether that optimism was justified on the basis of a relatively positive outlook for global activity, or whether it indicated the potential for financial conditions to tighten considerably if outcomes deteriorated, even modestly, relative to market expectations. In China, total social financing had increased as a result of very strong growth in Chinese Government bond issuance. Household credit growth had also picked up but remained very low, with weakness in the property sector an ongoing constraint. The Australian dollar had depreciated slightly on a trade-weighted basis since the previous monetary policy meeting. This had been driven by depreciation against the Chinese renminbi, the euro and the yen, and mainly reflected changing interest rate differentials. Commodity prices â another key determinant of the Australian dollar historically â had been little changed for several months. In trade-weighted terms, the Australian dollar was at the bottom of the range it had moved in over recent years and close to, or a little below, the various staff estimates of its long-run equilibrium value based on current information. Members noted that the Australian dollar had been an important automatic stabiliser for the economy in the face of sizeable global shocks and was expected to continue to play that role. Members noted that Australian householdsÂ debt servicing payments were still around their highest levels since 2012 as a share of household disposable income. Scheduled debt payments had stabilised relative to incomes over the second half of 2024, including because of growth in household incomes. However, households had increased their extra mortgage payments over the same period to pay down debt more quickly. Members noted that the reduction in the cash rate in February would reduce required household debt servicing payments somewhat and could provide indebted households with scope to finance higher consumption. While overall financial conditions in Australia had eased a little with the cut in the cash rate target in February, membersÂ assessment was that they were still restrictive. Members nonetheless explored the extent to which competition among banks over preceding years and other factors had relaxed financial conditions. Aggregate credit growth had been somewhat stronger than in the years leading into the pandemic, which was unusual during a period of relatively high interest rates and in contrast to other advanced economies. Business credit growth had strengthened further in preceding months, though housing credit growth had moderated alongside weak housing price growth. Household credit had declined a little relative to income over preceding years, and business debt had risen only slightly as a share of GDP, from low levels. International economic conditions Members discussed the implications for the global economy of ongoing trade policy uncertainty. The US administration had imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, increased tariffs on China and set 25Â perÂ cent tariffs on aluminium and steel imports from all countries. Canada, China and the European Union had announced retaliatory tariffs. The United States had signalled that it would raise tariffs further, with an announcement of additional tariffs expected shortly after the meeting. Members noted that a range of timely indicators of US economic sentiment had declined sharply, including consumer confidence, some business surveys and equity prices. This had increased the likelihood of lower growth in US household spending and business investment. Market economistsÂ forecasts for output growth in North America had been downgraded following announcements of higher tariffs, though forecasts for growth in AustraliaÂs major trading partners had been less affected so far. The overall impact on global growth would depend on the policy responses in other economies. Members noted that recent data had suggested some pick-up in growth in China. Chinese authorities had also confirmed a 5Â perÂ cent GDP growth target in 2025, backed by more supportive fiscal policy to offset headwinds from tariffs and the still-weak property sector. Members observed that the implications of tariffs for inflation could further complicate the global economic outlook. Inflation was still above central banksÂ targets in some advanced economies and progress on disinflation had stalled or even reversed a little in some cases. Against this backdrop, countries imposing tariffs could experience higher import prices, supply chain disruptions and efficiency losses (resulting from tariff-induced distortions to trade patterns). These developments would raise the price level. If they also resulted in inflationary pressures that offset the disinflationary effects of lower output growth, policymakers in countries imposing tariffs could be faced with the challenging combination of slowing output growth and higher inflation. A range of market economists saw this as the most likely outcome for the United States in the period ahead. The extent to which these international developments would affect the Australian economy was a further source of uncertainty and depended on a range of factors. Assuming the global tariffs announced so far and that the Australian Government did not impose retaliatory tariffs, a model-based scenario showed that the effects on GDP growth and inflation in Australia could be relatively modest. This reflected AustraliaÂs limited direct trade exposure to the United States, additional policy support in China and AustraliaÂs flexible exchange rate. There were clear downside risks for Australian growth relative to this scenario, if tariffs and policy uncertainty have a greater effect on global growth than expected, if the spillovers to Australia are larger or if there were further material increases in tariffs in other economies, including those that are important for Australia. However, the risks to Australian inflation were more two-sided and would depend on the timing and relative size of the effects on aggregate demand and supply: weaker global demand and the possibility of trade diversion away from the United States could reduce inflation in Australia, but a larger exchange rate depreciation or more substantial global supply disruptions could increase inflation. Members observed that concerns about US trade policy were already having a material influence on planning activities of some globally oriented Australian firms, but did not yet appear to be a widespread consideration for domestically focused firms. Similarly, trade measures were yet to have a significant effect on measured activity or inflation in Australia. Members nevertheless emphasised the importance of being alert to any signs of this changing. Domestic economic conditions Turning to domestic conditions, members noted that recent domestic data had been generally consistent with the forecasts in the February Statement on Monetary Policy. GDP growth had picked up in the December quarter 2024, broadly as expected and consistent with a continued recovery in domestic demand. In per capita terms, GDP had risen for the first time since late 2022, albeit only slightly. Private demand had increased modestly in the December quarter, led by household consumption, while public demand had continued to support growth. The limited information available about activity in early 2025 suggested that the pick-up in GDP growth had been sustained. Natural disasters in parts of Queensland and New South Wales, while having a significant impact on affected areas, were expected to have only a modest impact on aggregate GDP. The 2025/26Â Australian Government Budget had not conveyed material changes to the outlook for overall public demand. Household consumption growth had started to recover in the December quarter, underpinned by the ongoing pick-up in real household incomes. While some of this recovery in consumption appeared to reflect price-sensitive consumers concentrating spending in promotional periods during the December quarter, the pick-up in spending growth among components not affected by sales events suggested there had been a genuine improvement in underlying momentum. More recent indicators signalled that some of this pick-up had been sustained. Members noted the staffÂs overall assessment that labour market conditions remained tight. The unemployment rate had increased slightly in early 2025, as expected, and was little changed since mid-2024. Underemployment had declined further to its lowest level since early 2023. Other indicators had also contributed to the assessment that labour market conditions were tight, including job vacancies, job advertisements and the share of firms reporting labour availability as a significant constraint on output. However, the quits rate â which measures the share of employees voluntarily leaving jobs â had continued to decline, perhaps signalling that inter-firm competition for labour had eased. More broadly, the NAB measure of firmsÂ capacity utilisation had declined a little further in February, consistent with gradually easing capacity pressures outside the labour market. Members discussed the surprising decline in employment and the participation rate in February. Given this was only one monthÂs data, it seemed possible that the declines were a result of volatility in the monthly labour force data rather than an indication of softening in labour market conditions. Other sources of information were not indicating a sharp deterioration in employment growth: employment intentions from liaison and business surveys had stabilised or picked up a little recently, and income tax withholding collections had not exhibited any unusual patterns. Members agreed on the importance of monitoring employment outcomes closely over coming months. Data on wages and labour costs received since the previous monetary policy meeting had provided somewhat contradictory signals. Year-ended growth in the Wage Price Index (WPI) had eased in the December quarter 2024, to 3.2Â perÂ cent. This pace of wages growth was in line with expectations, but revisions to the quarterly data suggested there was slightly less momentum at the end of 2024 than had been expected. By contrast, average earnings from the national accounts and unit labour costs â which are more comprehensive but more volatile measures of labour compensation and labour costs than the WPI â had grown more strongly in late 2024 than expected. Unit labour costs had increased by around 5Â½Â perÂ cent over 2024, significantly higher than the average growth rate over the inflation targeting period, in part reflecting ongoing weakness in measured productivity. Members noted the staffÂs assessment that, on balance, the information in the data on wages and unit labour costs received in preceding weeks was broadly offsetting in terms of implications for the inflation outlook. This judgement would, however, be reviewed as part of the updated forecasts in May. The monthly CPI indicator suggested that trimmed mean inflation would be likely to fall below 3Â perÂ cent in the March quarter, even with some likely pick-up in the quarterly outcome because of anticipated strong growth in certain administered prices and the unwinding of some temporary factors. Recent outcomes in other inflation sub-components had been consistent with the staffÂs expectations. New dwelling construction prices had declined slightly in recent months, though advertised rents had been stronger than expected. Some firms continued to report in liaison that weak demand had limited the extent to which they could pass input cost pressures through to consumer prices. Members noted that the energy rebate extension announced in the Australian Government Budget would affect the profile of headline inflation in 2025 and 2026. Financial stability assessment Members considered the staffÂs semi-annual assessment of financial stability risks. The staff assessed that the Australian financial system had continued to display a high level of resilience, and that banks were well placed to continue supporting the economy even in the event of a significant economic downturn. Accordingly, members observed that there were no immediate implications for monetary policy arising from domestic financial stability considerations. While financial pressures remained pervasive across the Australian community, they had generally eased a little. This reflected lower inflation, the Stage 3Â income tax cuts and the reduction in the cash rate in February. The share of borrowers who had fallen behind on their mortgage payments had stabilised at around pre-pandemic levels, and most mortgagors had maintained large liquidity and equity buffers. While lower income borrowers had been more likely to fall behind on their mortgages, arrears rates for these borrowers were well contained and had been declining since mid-2024. Borrowers in aggregate had continued to add to prepayment buffers over recent months. The share of borrowers in severe financial stress was likely to decline further in the period ahead under the staffÂs central projections for the economy, although uncertainty about the outlook remained pronounced. Looking further ahead, members noted that the RBA and other regulators were attentive to vulnerabilities that might build in the financial system if households responded to an actual or anticipated easing in financial conditions by taking on excessive debt. While lending standards were currently sound, historical experience both in Australia and abroad suggested that periods of lower interest rates can coincide with riskier borrowing activity, a rapid increase in house prices and, at times, a relaxation of lending standards. Historically, borrowing by investors had been particularly sensitive to changes in conditions in the mortgage market. The potential for this activity to amplify the credit and housing market cycle would be monitored closely. Business insolvencies had continued to rise but, on a cumulative basis, were still slightly below their pre-pandemic trend. Members observed that broader spillovers to the financial system had been limited because insolvent firms were generally small and did not have significant levels of bank debt. Most business borrowers had continued to manage the pressures on their finances, and leading indicators of financial stress in the corporate sector â such as overdue trade credit â had stabilised or improved. Notwithstanding the resilience of the domestic financial system, members recognised the potential for heightened geopolitical tensions and global trade policy uncertainty to interact with existing vulnerabilities in the global financial system. In this context, members acknowledged the work being done by the RBA and other agencies of the Council of Financial Regulators to reinforce the resilience of the financial system to withstand geopolitical risks, including risks relating to cyber threats and potentially severe operational disruptions to financial and other national infrastructure. Members discussed several vulnerabilities in key international financial markets that also had the potential to affect the Australian financial system. Term premia for long-term advanced economy government bonds had begun to increase, after several years during which they had been unusually low, partly in response to deteriorating fiscal outlooks. Members noted the potential for more significant adjustments in global bond term premia if geopolitical or fiscal risks were to worsen. Compressed risk premia in US equity and credit markets also increased the likelihood that adverse news could spark a disorderly correction in international asset prices. The increased use of leverage and large positions established by some international hedge funds in key overseas financial markets had the potential to amplify such shocks. In an extreme scenario, a rapid and disorderly repricing in global asset markets and disruptions to funding markets had the potential to spill over to the Australian financial system. Domestically, members noted the importance of banks and superannuation funds ensuring their liquidity risk management frameworks were able to withstand severe-but-plausible liquidity shocks. In the past, the superannuation sector had generally displayed a high level of resilience to market shocks and fundsÂ investment activities had tended to support financial stability, but the growth in assets under management meant that strengthening superannuation fundsÂ governance and risk management practices remains a focus of regulators. Members also discussed the Australian Prudential Regulation AuthorityÂs expectations that smaller banks should take steps to improve the diversification of their liquidity portfolios. Considerations for monetary policy Turning to considerations for the monetary policy decision, members noted that the flow of data since the previous monetary policy meeting had been largely in line with the expectations of the staff. Inflation had continued to decline gradually. The labour market was judged to be tighter than was consistent with full employment and, at this stage, the large fall in employment in February was considered more likely to be a statistical aberration than a turning point in labour demand. Members assessed domestic financial conditions to be still somewhat restrictive. The most significant development in the period leading up to the meeting had been the significant rise in uncertainty about global trade policy, although the effect of this on sentiment and economic developments in Australia was not yet clear. In light of this assessment, members agreed that the outlook for inflation and the labour market set out in the February Statement on Monetary Policy remained an appropriate starting point for their policy deliberations. So far, the economy appeared to be tracking in line with the staffÂs forecasts, which were for underlying inflation to return to the 2-3Â perÂ cent range from mid-2025 before settling a little above the midpoint. Members turned their discussion to the risks that were most prominent in their thinking about the economic outlook, and the relative importance of these. They agreed that the risks to the outlook were two-sided, with some that could result in economic activity and inflation in Australia being weaker than expected and others that could result in economic activity and inflation strengthening more noticeably. Regarding risks emanating from the domestic economy, members judged that the nature and importance of these had not changed materially since the previous monetary policy meeting. They noted that several of the domestic risks could result in a tighter labour market and higher inflation were they to materialise. These risks included the potential for the tight labour market and strong growth in unit labour costs to have a more pronounced effect on inflation than anticipated. Members noted that it was also possible that the emerging recovery in domestic private demand could prove stronger than expected. They observed that this could occur if financial conditions were less restrictive than they currently assumed. Members also observed that an important assumption underpinning the forecasts was that productivity growth picked up and that this was not assured. They emphasised that the prolonged period of above-target inflation over prior years made these risks more salient and discussed the importance of not jeopardising the progress that has already been achieved in bringing inflation sustainably back to the midpoint of the target by easing monetary policy prematurely, particularly considering the experience of some other countries where disinflation appeared to have stalled. At the same time, members noted that several other domestically generated risks could see economic activity and inflation slow by more than expected. They observed that the degree of tightness in the labour market was still uncertain and that, if there turned out to be more capacity in the labour market than the staff had assessed, inflation could return to target sooner than currently forecast. The likelihood of that possibility would increase if the slowing in wages growth in late 2024 continued or if the recent weakness in employment persisted. It was also possible that the anticipated pick-up in consumption growth again proved to be overly optimistic. Regarding risks to the outlook for the global economy, members noted that these had increased and were tilted to the downside. They agreed that a significant further increase in global tariffs or other trade restrictions could materially disrupt global trade. Uncertainty about global economic policy settings could also lead firms and households to reduce spending and investment. If either of those consequences were to transpire, global economic activity could fall significantly, though the implications for inflation would be more complicated. Members agreed that the implications of global developments for the BoardÂs policy decisions would depend on their effects on Australian activity, inflation and employment. It was possible to envisage circumstances in which the impact was significant, and members acknowledged that it is important for monetary policy to be forward-looking. However, the information to hand did not imply a significant change in the outlook, despite the substantial level of uncertainty. Even with the recent adjustments in some markets, pricing in financial and commodity markets was cautiously optimistic. And heightened global uncertainty did not yet appear to be having a significant effect on domestic spending. Members noted that while concerns about global trade policy were receiving scrutiny by Australian companies that export to the United States, sentiment among domestically focused companies had not yet adjusted downwards. The implications for Australia of global tariff settings would also depend on how Chinese authorities respond, and members noted the Chinese authoritiesÂ stated commitment to maintaining output growth around 5Â perÂ cent. Importantly, the Board would need to monitor closely the implications of global developments for Australian inflation. Some of those developments could exert disinflationary pressure, including weak demand and the potential for trade diversion, but others could be inflationary, such as potential impairments to global supply chains and exchange rate depreciation. In light of these considerations, members agreed that it was appropriate to maintain the cash rate target at its current level at this meeting. There had not been sufficient information to alter the central outlook for the Australian economy significantly. In addition, members judged that it was not appropriate at this stage for monetary policy to react to the potential risks that could move outcomes in either direction. It was nevertheless important to remain alert to the evolving balance of risks. Members observed that the May meeting would be an opportune time to revisit the monetary policy setting with the benefit of additional data about inflation, wages, the labour market and trends in economic activity, along with a fresh set of economic forecasts and further information about the likely evolution of global trade policies. Collectively, this information would have a considerable bearing on their decision. Looking forward, the Board discussed the monetary policy strategy, which was to bring inflation back to the midpoint of the target band while maintaining as much of the gains in employment as possible. While the available information suggested that the strategy was on track, members agreed that it was not yet possible to determine the timing of the next move in interest rates. They noted that future decisions would, in each instance, depend on new information and its implications for the economic outlook. Members noted risks to the outlook on both sides, and that monetary policy was well placed to respond to international developments were they to have material implications for Australian activity and inflation. Given this, members agreed that it would be helpful if the BoardÂs public communication following the meeting made it clear that the outcome of its next decision was not predetermined. In finalising the policy statement, members emphasised the need to be cautious and alert to the evolving economic outlook, and the importance of future decisions being guided by the incoming information and the assessment of risks. They agreed that sustainably returning inflation to target is the BoardÂs highest priority and that it will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome. The decision The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 4.10Â perÂ cent, and the rate on Exchange Settlement balances unchanged at 4.00Â perÂ cent. Assessing the RBAÂs government bond holdings Members discussed the staffÂs latest assessment of the pace at which the RBAÂs holdings of government bonds were running down. The current approach â which had been endorsed by the Reserve Bank Board in December 2023 â is to hold these bonds until maturity but review it periodically. As in previous assessments, the paper considered the options of continuing with the current approach or reducing the RBAÂs holdings by gradually selling bonds. Members agreed that there were no clear reasons at present to vary the pace of rundown for monetary policy or financial stability purposes, but the scale and maturity structure of the holdings did have implications for the RBAÂs risks and returns. Given that, members agreed to seek the views of the Governance Board on risk and return considerations. A decision could then be made in due course on the basis of those considerations and any potential implications for monetary policy and financial stability.

2025-05-20,"Minutes of the Monetary Policy Board Meeting Hybrid â 19Â and 20Â May 2025 Members participating MicheleÂ Bullock (Governor and Chair), AndrewÂ Hauser (Deputy Governor and Deputy Chair), MarnieÂ Baker, RenÃ©eÂ FryâMcKibbin, IanÂ HarperÂ AO, CarolynÂ HewsonÂ AO, StevenÂ KennedyÂ PSM, IainÂ RossÂ AO, AlisonÂ WatkinsÂ AM Others participating SarahÂ Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), ChristopherÂ Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets) AnthonyÂ Dickman (Secretary), DavidÂ Norman (Deputy Secretary) MeredithÂ Beechey Osterholm (Head, Monetary Policy Strategy), SallyÂ Cray (Chief Communications Officer), DavidÂ Jacobs (Head, Domestic Markets Department), MichaelÂ Plumb (Head, Economic Analysis Department), PenelopeÂ Smith (Head, International Department) Financial conditions Members began their discussion by considering the evolving news on US tariff policy and its impact on global financial markets. The tariffs announced by the US administration on 2Â April and subsequent days had been much higher than expected and had led to retaliation in kind by China. Subsequent decisions had paused or reduced some of these increases, at least temporarily; however, at the time of the meeting tariffs were still well above previous levels and future tariff decisions remained highly unpredictable. In response, financial markets had been turbulent. Equity prices, bond yields and many commodity prices had initially fallen quite sharply, and expected volatility in US equity markets had risen to levels only exceeded in recent decades during the global financial crisis and the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these moves had all been largely or fully unwound, leaving pricing in many global financial markets only modestly changed compared with the time of the previous meeting. Financial market participantsÂ expectations for central bank policy rates in many advanced economies had also declined initially and then recovered, but the recovery in policy rate expectations had generally been incomplete. Markets expected most central banks to continue lowering interest rates from their current levels. Longer term government bond yields in advanced economies had initially declined following the tariff announcements but were generally higher than at the time of the previous meeting, especially in the United States. Market functioning had been somewhat strained at times. Members noted that concerns about the US fiscal position appeared to have contributed to rising term premia. Measures of inflation compensation on US bonds had increased at shorter terms but had fallen over longer horizons, perhaps reflecting an expectation that current tariff settings would be reversed. Inflation compensation on bonds issued by most other countries had declined, driven by falling oil prices and concerns over the impact of tariffs on growth. In corporate funding markets, both equity prices and spreads on corporate bonds had largely recovered from sharp sell-offs immediately following the 2Â April tariffs announcement. In several markets, including Australia, equity prices were now higher than before that announcement. Members discussed how the rebound could be reconciled with the likely adverse effects on global growth of persistently higher tariffs and policy uncertainty. One possibility was that market participants expected further reversals in tariffs. Another was that they expected the effects of tariffs to be more or less offset by stimulatory fiscal and monetary policy in the United States, China and elsewhere, or by the US administrationÂs planned deregulation agenda. Members noted that such assumptions might prove overly optimistic. They also noted that an adverse global economic outlook was likely to be worse for smaller businesses (which typically are not represented on public equity markets), given they generally have smaller cash buffers. The Australian dollar had also been volatile, depreciating sharply in early April before rebounding. On a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar was around the same level as it was in late 2024. A broad-based depreciation of the USÂ dollar and the Chinese renminbi since early April had offset depreciation of the Australian dollar against the currencies of most other trading partners. Members discussed the somewhat unexpected depreciation of the USÂ dollar in response to the announced increase in US tariffs, which might have been expected to produce an appreciation as the outlook for import growth worsened. The depreciation might reflect an uncertainty premium being applied to US-dollar assets, a correction of previously overweight exposures to US assets or changes in hedging behaviour. Members then turned to consider how broader Australian financial conditions had evolved. Like the USÂ dollar, Australian markets had been similarly volatile in response to the news about tariffs. Liquidity had declined sharply in the bond market for a time, as it had in other jurisdictions, as a significant number of participants sought to unwind common positions quickly. However, markets had continued to function adequately, and there had not been a broader shift to cash as seen during the global financial crisis or the pandemic. The demand for liquidity at the RBAÂs operations had been little changed overall, in part because the level of reserves remains high. Market expectations for future monetary policy in Australia had moved markedly lower for a time in early April but had partly retraced since then. The swing in policy expectations had been more amplified in Australia than in other economies, largely reflecting thin liquidity in markets but possibly also AustraliaÂs greater trade exposure to China, the flow of domestic data and a perception that international developments were more likely to weigh on inflation in Australia. Policy rate expectations were now consistent with monetary policy being eased by a little more than had been expected at the previous meeting. Market pricing implied a total of around three 25Â basis point reductions this year, a little more than expected at the time of the previous meeting. A 25Â basis point reduction in the cash rate at the current meeting was widely anticipated. The shift lower in policy rate expectations had been due to both international developments and domestic data relating to consumption and inflation. Members noted that the market-implied path of the cash rate lay within the wide â and inherently uncertain â range of model-based and market economistsÂ estimates of the neutral interest rate. Growth in housing credit had been stable in recent months, at around its post-2008 average and a little below growth in household incomes. By contrast, business credit growth had been running ahead of nominal GDP growth, despite weakness in business investment. Members discussed some potential explanations for this, including business credit growth being supported by firms seeking to raise previously low levels of leverage and strong competition among lenders. Issuance of corporate bonds had paused during the period of heightened volatility in early April but had since resumed. Scheduled household debt payments had eased following the reduction in the cash rate in February but were still around their highest levels since 2012. Extra mortgage payments remained above their pre-pandemic average, consistent with the weakness seen in household consumption. Members noted that some banks do not automatically adjust mortgage payments following a reduction in lending rates, which would have mechanically increased extra payments into redraw accounts as interest rates fell. Economic conditions Members turned their discussion to how a persistent increase in trade barriers would affect the global economy. They noted that policy unpredictability had created a highly uncertain environment, depressing sentiment measures in several developed economies outside Australia; in itself, that could weigh on spending by businesses and households abroad. But the overall impact on global growth would also depend on a range of other factors, including the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations, how easily global trading patterns adjust to new tariff settings, and the fiscal and monetary policy response of authorities. Members noted that Chinese authorities had already eased monetary policy and had indicated their willingness to ease fiscal settings further to support economic growth. Authorities in some other economies (particularly in Europe) had also signalled that fiscal settings would be loosened. Members considered the potential effects on global inflation, noting that these were ambiguous and likely to vary across countries. Inflation in the United States was expected to increase in the near term as higher tariffs would, to some extent, be passed through to consumer prices. Countries not levying new tariffs, including Australia, were more likely to see downward pressure on inflation as weaker global demand and the possible diversion of goods that would otherwise have been sold to the United States depressed prices. But it was also possible that tariffs could impair the complex interlinkages in global supply chains, in turn lifting the prices of traded goods globally. Members noted that the available data suggested that, prior to the escalation in international trade tensions, economic activity in Australia had been evolving broadly as expected three months earlier. GDP growth had increased in the December quarter 2024 and year-ended growth looked to have picked up a little further in the March quarter. Within that aggregate, indicators of household spending suggested that growth in consumption in early 2025 had been a little lower than expected in February. In part that reflected the impact of flooding in Queensland and New South Wales. But underlying momentum also appeared to have been a little weaker, continuing a pattern that had been evident for some time. Members observed that earlier declines in real household disposable income remained a constraint on consumption, though higher household wealth provided some offset. The limited information available for the June quarter suggested that recent international developments had so far had little impact on domestic activity. Survey measures of business and consumer sentiment had been little changed. While liaison contacts had noted uncertainty about the international outlook, they still perceived domestic conditions as generally favourable and most were not yet revising their investment or hiring decisions in response to global developments. Labour market conditions had also so far remained in line with the previous forecasts. The unemployment rate had been around 4.1Â perÂ cent since the middle of 2024, while the underemployment rate had declined a little over that period. Employment had recovered from the surprising fall recorded in February. As expected, wages growth had increased slightly in the March quarter, owing to some administered wage decisions and new agreements coming into effect, but it remained lower than a year earlier. Members observed that the rate of voluntary job turnover had declined and that, anecdotally, the focus of wage bargaining and employment disputes had tilted in favour of workers seeking greater job security. Some questioned whether this might see wages growth slow more noticeably than currently forecast. Members welcomed the broad-based easing in underlying inflation over the preceding year. Trimmed mean inflation had returned to the 2â3Â perÂ cent range for the first time since late 2021 and, in six-month annualised terms, was at the midpoint of that range. Although this path had been expected, it provided welcome confirmation that potential upside inflationary risks had not crystallised. Members noted that services price inflation had eased back to around its historical average and that new dwelling costs had fallen further. Headline CPI inflation had been unchanged at 2.4Â perÂ cent in year-ended terms in the March quarter and continued to be affected by the timing of payments under government cost-of-living relief measures to households. Members considered what these developments implied for the degree of spare capacity in the economy. The staffÂs assessment was that there was still some tightness in the labour market. This was consistent with a range of indicators, including survey measures of the share of firms reporting that labour availability is constraining output, the high level of job vacancies, and persistently high growth in unit labour costs. Members discussed the extent to which downward pressure on firmsÂ margins had weighed on inflation, including in house building, noting that there were reports from liaison that weak demand had limited the ability of firms to pass increases in input costs fully through to output prices. They acknowledged that, while broader capacity pressures in the economy appeared to have eased, there remained considerable uncertainty around assessments of the degree of spare capacity. Outlook Members noted that the outlook for the global economy had deteriorated over the preceding three months, given developments in trade policies, but that the extent of the deterioration was unusually uncertain. In the baseline forecast â which assumed that tariffs remain around their current levels and that policy uncertainty gradually falls but remains high â growth in AustraliaÂs major trading partners (weighted by their share of AustraliaÂs exports) was expected to slow in 2025 and 2026. The largest downgrades to the growth outlook had been for the United States and several other countries with a high reliance on goods trade. By contrast, the outlook for output growth in China was little changed, reflecting an assumption of increased policy stimulus. Members noted that sentiment in China had improved prior to the announcement of significantly higher-than-expected US tariffs on imports from China, and that authorities there appeared to be both committed to their growth target of around 5Â perÂ cent and able to provide more stimulus to the economy if required. In light of those developments, and the most recent domestic data, the baseline forecast was for Australian GDP growth to pick up a little less rapidly than forecast three months earlier. That reflected three main assumptions: global demand for Australian exports was projected to be somewhat weaker; some weight was placed on the possibility that heightened policy uncertainty might dampen domestic investment and household spending; and near-term momentum in consumption was a little weaker. The technical assumption of a lower cash rate path than in the February forecasts provided some offset to the forecast for domestic activity. The weaker outlook for Australian GDP growth in the baseline forecast resulted in the forecast rise in the unemployment rate being slightly larger than previously expected, and the forecast for inflation being slightly lower. Underlying inflation was now expected to be around the midpoint of the 2â3Â perÂ cent target range throughout the forecast period. Headline CPI inflation was forecast to be more volatile because of the effects of government energy rebates, and to exceed the target range for a time in early 2026. Given that the rapidly evolving and unpredictable global policy environment was creating more uncertainty than usual around the baseline forecasts, members also considered a range of alternative scenarios for how the Australian economy might evolve under different policy assumptions. One of these scenarios involved an escalation of the trade conflict in which much higher levels of tariffs are imposed permanently, causing global sentiment, growth and asset prices to fall sharply. Absent a material policy response, this would be likely to cause a sharp slowing in Australian GDP growth and an associated sharp rise in the unemployment rate. By contrast, there were scenarios in which there was a swift easing in the trade conflict, which could reduce policy uncertainty. Such scenarios, if still accompanied by stronger policy stimulus abroad than previously expected, could result in a more pronounced recovery in Australian output growth and somewhat higher inflation. Considerations for monetary policy Turning to considerations for the monetary policy decision, members noted that there had been further welcome progress towards the BoardÂs objectives. Underlying inflation had continued to decline, in line with prior projections, and the forecasts were for it to remain close to the midpoint of the 2â3Â perÂ cent range over the forecast period. Activity had picked up and employment growth had remained solid. The labour market was still judged by the staff to be tight and the output gap slightly positive, although there remained significant uncertainty about these judgements. In contrast with domestic conditions, which had evolved close to expectations, there had been significant and unexpectedly adverse developments in the global economy. It was challenging to predict how global trade policy would evolve, but most scenarios posed some downside risk to Australian activity and inflation â and there were some scenarios in which the impact could be significant. The uncertainty associated with global trade policy had also caused liquidity in financial markets to become strained for a time, though this had mostly recovered. Members assessed monetary policy to be still somewhat restrictive at the current level of the cash rate, although the extent of that restrictiveness was subject to considerable uncertainty. In light of these developments, members considered whether to leave the cash rate target unchanged at this meeting or to lower it. The case to hold the cash rate target unchanged rested on three main considerations. First, while underlying inflation had returned to the 2â3Â perÂ cent range, headline inflation was expected to rise back up to the top of the target band as energy subsidies unwound. Moreover, labour and product markets remained relatively tight, implying some risk to inflation being contained. Second, there had so far been few observable effects on the Australian economy from developments in the global economy, and policy was evolving on an almost daily basis, so there could be a case for waiting to see if more convincing signs of a domestic impact emerged before adjusting policy. Third, to the extent that the stance of monetary policy was judged not to be very restrictive at its current level, it might not yet be appropriate to relax it. The case to lower the cash rate target rested on three different considerations. First, the progress made in returning inflation to target without upside risks having crystalised. Second, an assessment that global developments and near-term trends in household consumption had shifted the balance of risks downwards. And third, the possibility that the prevailing uncertainty from global events might best be managed by adopting a path of least regret, which, given the current distribution of risks, would be likely to involve a lower cash rate. In discussing the case to ease policy, members observed that trends in domestic conditions could, on their own, justify some degree of reduction in the cash rate target at this meeting. Underlying inflation had continued to ease as expected, was back at the midpoint of the 2â3Â perÂ cent range in six-month annualised terms and was forecast to remain close to the midpoint throughout the forecast period. The forecast was also conditioned on a technical assumption for the cash rate that incorporated a reduction at this meeting. And the downward revision to the staffÂs forecast for consumption suggested there might be a little less momentum in private demand than previously assumed. Developments in the global economy since the previous meeting strengthened the case for a reduction in the cash rate target. Members noted that the rise in global tariffs and increase in policy uncertainty had adversely changed the outlook for growth in AustraliaÂs major trading partners. It was difficult to quantify the impact of this on Australian activity at this early stage, while international trade policy was still in flux. But the baseline forecast was for a negative effect; and there were scenarios in which output growth could be materially weaker than this. Members noted that, while it was possible that higher global tariffs could lift Australian inflation through impaired supply chains, it was more likely that they would prove to be disinflationary, through weaker aggregate demand. Having weighed up these alternative arguments, members judged that the case to reduce the cash rate target was the stronger one. They agreed that monetary policy had been effective in bringing inflation back to target, and that it was no longer necessary to be as restrictive given the current rate of inflation and the staffÂs assessment of spare capacity. In addition, members judged that a lower cash rate would also be an appropriate response to the downside risks that had emerged from international developments since the previous meeting. Having determined that it was appropriate to lower the cash rate target at this meeting, members turned their attention to the size of the reduction. A 25Â basis point reduction in the cash rate target at this meeting would be consistent with the technical assumption for the path of the cash rate underpinning the baseline staff forecast, which had underlying inflation expected to remain around the midpoint of the target range over the forecast period. It would recognise the progress made on inflation and the slightly softer outlook for domestic consumption suggested by recent data. It would also give weight to the likelihood that global developments will slow the recovery in activity growth somewhat, while recognising that international trade policy settings were still fluctuating and that so far there were no data signalling an adverse impact on domestic demand in Australia. A 25Â basis point reduction would ensure that monetary policy settings remained predictable at a time of heightened uncertainty, given market expectations. And it would leave the Board well placed to respond as needed as the economy evolved. Limiting the reduction to 25Â basis points could be justified by several key uncertainties to the outlook. There were concerns about the strength of the supply side of the Australian economy: for example, productivity growth so far had shown no signs of increasing, and uncertainty about the extent of tightness in the labour market was two-sided. It was also possible that the forecast increase in aggregate demand would facilitate a recovery in profit margins, which would provide more momentum to inflation than expected. And the imposition of higher tariffs in other countries might prove more disruptive for global supply chains than had been factored into the baseline forecasts, raising prices globally. More broadly, members observed that it could be challenging for households and firms if the Board subsequently sought to reverse a loosening in policy that, in hindsight, proved to be too rapid. On the other hand, a larger reduction in the cash rate target at this meeting could be appropriate if members judged that the downside risks stemming from either global or domestic developments warranted easing monetary policy more quickly than assumed in the baseline forecast. Members discussed scenarios in which global policy unpredictability had more negative consequences for the world economy than was assumed in the baseline, including the adverse scenario set out in the May Statement on Monetary Policy. They agreed that monetary policy would need to move to an expansionary setting in the event these scenarios materialised. Members observed that there were also downside risks to the outlook stemming from the domestic economy, including that household consumption does not pick up as quickly as envisaged in the baseline forecast or that wages growth slows by more than forecast alongside a softening labour market. In light of this, members noted that a reduction in the cash rate could be warranted on the basis of either domestic or global factors, and that the combination of these might therefore warrant a 50Â basis point reduction at this meeting. Members noted that it would be important that a larger reduction at this meeting should not be taken as implying a view that the cash rate path should be lower over the entire forecast period, merely that it reaches the same level sooner to provide greater insurance against more adverse scenarios. Having weighed up these alternative arguments, members decided that the case to lower the cash rate target by 25Â basis points at this meeting was the stronger one. They agreed that developments in the domestic economy on their own justified a reduction in the cash rate target and that the case for that action was strengthened by developments in global trade policy. However, members were not persuaded that the combination of these was sufficient to warrant a 50Â basis point reduction at this meeting. Members noted the absence of signs in the Australian data to date that global trade policy uncertainty was having a significant negative impact on the economy, and that some plausible adverse scenarios could see upward pressure on inflation. They also judged that it was not yet time to move monetary policy to an expansionary stance, taking account of the range of estimates involved, given that inflation was yet to return sustainably to the midpoint of the target range and the staffÂs assessment that the labour market was still tight. These considerations and the prevailing global policy uncertainty led members to express a preference to move cautiously and predictably when withdrawing some of the current policy restriction. In finalising the policy statement, members agreed that it was appropriate to convey their commitment to both of the BoardÂs objectives. They also agreed to convey that policy was well placed to respond decisively to international developments if they were to have material implications for activity and inflation of the kind described in the severe downside scenario set out in the May Statement on Monetary Policy. Members affirmed that future decisions will be guided by the incoming data and the evolving assessment of risks. They agreed that the Board should remain focused on its mandate to deliver both price stability and full employment and that it will do what it considers necessary to achieve that outcome.
