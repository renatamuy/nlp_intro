					<h2>Economic conditions</h2>
					<p>Members began their discussion by noting that the economic data received since the previous meeting had
						been broadly in line with the staffs expectations.</p>
					<p>Recent data on inflation had been consistent with a further gradual easing in underlying inflationary
						pressures. Looking ahead, monthly CPI data for August – to be released the day after the meeting
						– were expected to show a sharp decline in headline inflation, partly because of federal and state
						government cost-of-living relief. But underlying inflation was expected to remain above target. Inflation
						for some components had remained high and persistent, but the easing in the rate of growth in advertised
						rents over the preceding three months was expected to feed through gradually to lower rent inflation in
						the CPI.</p>
					<p>Growth in GDP in the June quarter had been in line with the staffs expectations. However, the
						composition of that growth suggested somewhat less underlying momentum in aggregate demand than the staff
						had assumed. Notably, household consumption had been significantly weaker than expected, while the
						offsetting stronger-than-expected outcomes were in components that tended to be more volatile from
						quarter to quarter. Members observed that weak growth in output was closing the gap between aggregate
						demand and the economys estimated supply capacity, but that the two were not yet aligned.</p>
					<p>Members discussed the implications of the weaker-than-expected outcome for household consumption in the
						June quarter. This was seen to have reflected a combination of a genuine slowing in momentum and the
						unwinding of one-off spending in the March quarter. Bank transaction data suggested that the recent
						weakness in household spending had been broadly based across different types of households, including
						those without mortgages. Strong growth in government consumption – which includes the provision of
						services to households – meant that overall consumption growth had been more resilient than implied
						by household consumption alone but was still below its pre-pandemic average.</p>
					<p>A key question was how spending was evolving in the September quarter. The staff had previously forecast
						household consumption to strengthen in response to a recovery in real incomes, including because of the
						implementation of the Stage 3 tax cuts in July. Members considered whether this forecast was still
						consistent with available timely indicators of household spending, including the signals derived from
						bank transaction data and retail sales. These suggested that growth in spending had been weak in July but
						had strengthened somewhat in August. Retailers in the RBAs liaison program had reported that
						conditions had remained stable over prior months and were generally expected to stay that way over coming
						months. Based on this information, members judged that it was still reasonable to expect a pick-up in
						consumption growth over the second half of the year, but it was too soon to form firm views based on
						these partial indicators and there was some risk that the pick-up could be somewhat slower than
						previously expected. Members also noted that the official statistical treatment of the cost-of-living
						subsidies provided to households would have the effect of reallocating measured spending in the September
						quarter from household to public consumption.</p>
					<p>Turning to the prospects for trade, members noted that global economic indicators had been somewhat weaker
						over preceding months. The outlook for the Chinese economy had softened and this had been reflected in
						weaker demand for iron ore and lower commodity prices, despite the earlier easing of monetary policy. In
						many advanced economies, conditions in labour markets had eased materially and job vacancies had returned
						to pre-pandemic levels, unlike in Australia. Inflation had also declined in these economies and central
						banks had become more confident of returning inflation sustainably to target. In that context, some
						central banks – including the US Federal Reserve – had focused on downside risks to labour
						markets in recent communications.</p>
					<p>The cap on international student commencements to be applied to the higher education and vocational
						education and training sectors in Australia from 2025 was expected to weigh on services exports. Members
						noted that the cap was in addition to the earlier tightening in requirements for student visa applicants,
						which had already seen a fall in student visa grants. However, the implications of lower student arrivals
						for the balance between aggregate demand and supply, and hence for the inflation outlook, were less
						clear. Lower numbers of international student arrivals would be likely to reduce aggregate demand
						(including for housing), but also lower growth in population and therefore the economys supply
						capacity. The implications of these various effects would be assessed more carefully as part of the
						subsequent forecast update.</p>
					<p>Members judged that labour market conditions in Australia were still tight relative to both full
						employment and conditions in other economies. The share of unemployed people finding jobs was high and
						the share of workers losing their jobs was very low. Conditions had nonetheless continued to ease as
						expected and indicators of future labour market conditions suggested that would continue. The
						unemployment rate had increased a little over preceding months as strong growth in the supply of labour
						(including through higher participation) was only partially absorbed by solid employment growth. Members
						noted that the rise in participation reflected a combination of jobs being readily available and the
						effect of financial pressures from the higher cost of living.</p>
					<p>Members considered medium-term developments in labour productivity growth, which remained subdued. In
						part, that reflected a rising share of employment in the non-market sector, where measured productivity
						had declined over prior years. However, productivity outcomes had also been weak in a range of market
						industries, a trend evident in many other economies. Overall, the information received from the June
						quarter national accounts had reinforced concerns about future growth in supply. In turn, this could have
						implications for the sustainable pace of wages growth. Members noted that wages growth had continued to
						ease in the June quarter from high levels, broadly as expected.</p>
					<h2>Financial conditions</h2>
					<p>Members commenced their discussion of financial conditions by noting that several advanced economy central
						banks had reduced their policy rates since the previous meeting, in response to easing labour market
						conditions and progress in returning inflation sustainably to target; they had also communicated that
						further policy easing was likely. Market participants expected policy rates to reach central bank
						estimates of neutral levels by around the end of 2025. An exception was the Bank of Japan, which had
						communicated that it would be appropriate to raise its policy rate further from current low levels if
						underlying inflation increased as forecast.</p>
					<p>Financial market conditions had been calmer following the bout of extreme volatility around the time of
						the previous meeting. However, several of the factors that had contributed to the volatility remained in
						place, such as elevated risk-taking and leveraged positions.</p>
					<p>Members noted that financial market pricing across a range of asset classes in advanced economies was
						consistent with expectations of a soft economic landing. Sovereign bond yields in most advanced economies
						had declined further since the August meeting, reflecting both an easing in expectations for policy rates
						and a decline in inflation expectations. Other measures of financial conditions had also eased as
						volatility subsided and risk premia declined. Corporate bond yields in the United States and European
						countries had declined to year-to-date lows, including because of narrower spreads to sovereign bonds.
					</p>
					<p>In China, weakness in the property sector had continued to weigh on credit demand and economic activity.
						Authorities had intervened to lean against declines in longer term government bond yields and the
						renminbi had appreciated alongside a narrowing of <span class="no-wrap">China–US</span> interest rate
						differentials.</p>
					<p>The Australian dollar trade-weighted index had traded within the range observed since early 2022, despite
						some volatility around the time of the August meeting. The exchange rate had been affected by a widening
						in yield differentials arising from market participants expectations that other central banks would
						reduce their policy rates by more than the RBA. The effect of this on the exchange rate had been offset
						somewhat by declines in commodity prices.</p>
					<p>Members judged that Australian financial conditions remained restrictive overall but had eased somewhat
						over preceding months. Market expectations for the path of the cash rate were materially lower than a few
						months earlier, and bond yields and some lending and deposit rates had declined in tandem. Housing credit
						growth had also gradually increased, and business credit growth was above its average pace since the
						global financial crisis. Funding conditions more generally for Australian financial and non-financial
						corporations remained favourable. Members discussed the implications of this for future business
						investment and concluded that it seemed unlikely financial conditions would be a binding constraint on
						investment for most businesses.</p>
					<p>While market expectations for the path of the cash rate were lower than a few months earlier, members
						noted that they had risen in response to the Governors comments that, based on data to hand at the
						August meeting, the Board did not expect to lower rates in the near term. Market pricing suggested that
						participants expected the RBA to start cutting the cash rate from around late 2024 or early 2025, but at
						a more gradual pace than that expected in several other advanced economies. That was consistent with the
						fact that policy rates in most other advanced economies had been increased earlier and to more
						restrictive levels than in Australia, and that inflation appeared to be returning sustainably to target
						more quickly in those economies. Market expectations were nevertheless for the stance of monetary policy
						in those countries (as measured by gaps between the policy rate and central bank estimates of the neutral
						interest rate) to be more restrictive than in Australia until around late 2025.</p>
					<h2>Financial stability assessment</h2>
					<p>Members discussed the staffs semi-annual assessment of financial stability risks. In the context of
						an easing in inflation globally and an uncertain economic outlook, the staffs assessment was that
						vulnerabilities in the global financial system remain. Three vulnerabilities stood out as having the
						potential to affect financial stability in Australia significantly, namely:</p>
					<ul>
<li>increased complexity and interconnectedness in the financial system, in part reflecting
							digitalisation and rapid technological development, had created operational vulnerabilities and
							central points of failure</li>
						<li>low market risk premia had raised the prospect of a disorderly adjustment in financial asset prices,
							including if expectations for a soft landing in the global economy were not realised and particularly
							in the context of rising government debt and the absence of medium-term fiscal frameworks </li>
						<li>longstanding vulnerabilities in the Chinese financial system – affecting banks, non-banks and
							local governments – had been exacerbated by the ongoing weakness in the Chinese real estate
							sector. </li>
					</ul>
<p>Members observed the potential for global threats originating from outside the financial system, such as
						geopolitical risks and climate change, to interact with these vulnerabilities with adverse effects. For
						example, heightened geopolitical tensions had increased the prospect of cyber-attacks that could have
						systemic implications. Members noted that the RBA is working with market participants and the other
						agencies of the Council of Financial Regulators to strengthen the operational resilience of the
						Australian financial system.</p>
					<p>Domestically, members recognised that financial pressures from persistent inflation and restrictive
						monetary policy meant many households were having to make difficult adjustments to their spending and
						financial arrangements. At the same time, risks to the Australian financial system from lending to
						households and businesses remained contained. In part, that reflected the fact that banks had maintained
						prudent lending standards and built substantial capital over recent years, leaving them well positioned
						to continue supporting the economy through credit provision. But it also reflected the fact that the
						share of borrowers experiencing severe financial stress had remained small, with housing loan arrears
						having increased only gradually from low levels. The increase was greatest for highly leveraged
						borrowers, but these comprised a very small share of lending. Very few borrowers were in negative equity.
					</p>
					<p>Members observed that borrowers resilience had been supported by prevailing savings buffers and the
						ongoing strength in the labour market. Most borrowers had maintained or added to their mortgage
						prepayment buffers over the preceding year; that said, there was a range of experiences and some
						borrowers were regularly drawing on their savings. High-income borrowers were the only group that in
						aggregate were running down their prepayment buffers, but their buffers remained large and were declining
						partly to fund discretionary consumption. Most borrowers were still likely to have spare cash flow under
						a range of plausible scenarios, including one in which there was a marked deterioration in the labour
						market. A more sustained reduction in inflation would also help to ease financial pressures.</p>
					<p>The strong financial position of most businesses prior to the slowing in the economy had supported their
						ability to navigate the recent period. Members noted that the sharp increase in business insolvencies
						– particularly for small businesses and in the hospitality sector – partly reflected a period
						of catch-up following the removal of pandemic-era support. The cumulative level of insolvencies was still
						below the pre-pandemic trend, and most insolvencies so far had involved small businesses with little
						debt, limiting the broader spillovers to lenders. The share of banks business loans in arrears had
						remained low.</p>
					<p>Members discussed the expansion of business lending by non-banks, as favourable funding conditions had
						enabled them to claim market share from banks. While there was limited information about the quality of
						this lending, its small size limited systemic risks. Elsewhere in the non-bank sector, the significant
						growth of the superannuation sector had increased its importance to the smooth functioning of the
						financial system. While financial stability risks were limited by most funds having a defined
						contribution structure in which leverage was restricted, the growing size of the industry underscored the
						importance of maintaining strong liquidity risk management practices.</p>
					<p>Members agreed that financial stability concerns were not a constraint on monetary policy at the time of
						the meeting. However, looking ahead, they discussed the potential for financial sector vulnerabilities to
						build if easier financial conditions were to lead higher risk borrowers to take on excessive debt and/or
						lenders to compete more aggressively by lowering lending standards. Members noted the RBA Reviews
						recommendation that decisions about monetary and macroprudential policy should be coordinated in such a
						situation.</p>
					<h2>Review of the Term Funding Facility</h2>
					<p>Members discussed the review of the Term Funding Facility (TFF), which was one component of the
						monetary policy package to support the Australian economy during the <span class="no-wrap">COVID-19</span> pandemic. The review concluded that the TFF had met its policy goals,
						which were to: reinforce the benefits to the economy of a lower cash rate by reducing the funding costs
						of banks and, in turn, interest rates paid by borrowers; and encourage banks to support businesses during
						a difficult period. Members agreed that the TFF had contributed effectively to restoring confidence in
						financial markets, keeping credit flowing and stimulating aggregate demand. They agreed that a facility
						of this type should remain one of the policy options to be considered if future circumstances warranted
						the use of unconventional monetary policy.</p>
					<p>Members discussed the lessons from the experience with the TFF. They noted the importance of effective
						contingency planning ahead of considering the use of unconventional monetary policy tools, including
						ensuring operational readiness, effective risk management and appropriate governance. Members also
						observed the trade-offs that could be considered in the design of any future scheme. For instance, the
						fixed rate feature of the TFF was judged at the time to be important to ensure consistency with other
						elements of the monetary policy package deployed in response to the pandemic, despite bringing greater
						financial risk to the RBA.</p>
					<p>Nearly half of the financial losses stemming from the TFF were because of its extension in September 2020.
						Members discussed whether that decision was appropriate, given the information available at the time.
						They highlighted: the international evidence supporting the need for strong action when interest rates
						are near zero; the value of coordinating with fiscal responses in such circumstances; the extreme
						uncertainty about the impact of the virus on the economy and of the impending end of the JobKeeper scheme
						at the time; and the way the TFF reinforced other elements of the monetary policy package. On the other
						hand, the lack of drawdown by banks until close to the September 2020 deadline signalled that they might
						not have needed additional funding. In addition, the potential implications for the RBAs finances
						of the TFF extension had been subject to only limited stress testing. Members concluded that these
						observations emphasised the importance of considering a wide range of scenarios when making any future
						policy decisions involving unconventional monetary policy measures.</p>
					<p>The Board agreed to publish the review, which would be accompanied by a speech by the Assistant Governor
						(Financial Markets).</p>
					<h2>Considerations for monetary policy</h2>
					<p>Turning to considerations for the immediate policy decision, members noted that the information received
						since the previous meeting had been mixed. Taken together, the information had not materially altered
						their assessment of the economic outlook as of this meeting. Underlying inflation was still too high and,
						in quarterly terms, had fallen very little over the preceding year.</p>
					<p>Output growth remained weak: GDP growth in the June quarter had been in line with expectations but
						household consumption had been notably weaker than expected. The staff still judged it as likely that
						consumption growth would pick up alongside the expected recovery in real disposable income in the second
						half of the year. It was too soon to judge how rapidly this would occur, though higher frequency data
						suggested there was a risk that it could be delayed somewhat.</p>
					<p>Risks around the outlook for Australias exports had shifted to the downside since the prior meeting.
						In part, this reflected a greater prospect of slower global output growth, given further increases in
						unemployment rates in some countries and the weakness in the Chinese economy. Members observed that
						services exports were also likely to be weaker than forecast in August because of the various policy
						measures relating to overseas student numbers. The implications of this for inflation were less clear
						though, given the potential offsetting implications for labour supply.</p>
					<p>Growth in employment had remained solid over prior months, including in comparison with other economies.
						The unemployment rate had risen gradually but conditions in the labour market still appeared to be
						tighter than those consistent with sustainable full employment. Members judged that the level of
						aggregate demand was still above the level of aggregate supply. Weak productivity growth was constraining
						the economys potential growth rate.</p>
					<p>Financial conditions had eased over prior months, as cash rate expectations and bond yields declined and
						equity prices rose. Credit growth had picked up and banks were well placed to support the economy.
						Members observed that many households were experiencing financial pressure but only a small share of
						households and firms were not able to service their loans. The exchange rate had appreciated a little
						but, in trade-weighted terms, was within its range of recent years.</p>
					<p>Taken together, members felt that not enough had changed since the previous meeting to alter their
						assessment that the current level of the cash rate best balanced the risks to inflation and the labour
						market. They therefore agreed that it was appropriate to leave the cash rate target unchanged at this
						meeting.</p>
					<p>Looking ahead, members reiterated that the data and the evolving assessment of risks would guide their
						future decisions on what path of interest rates would bring inflation to target within a reasonable
						timeframe, while preserving the gains in the labour market.</p>
					<p>Members then discussed scenarios in which future monetary policy might need to be held restrictive for a
						prolonged period or tightened further. One of these was if consumption growth were to pick up materially
						in response to the recovery in real household disposable income that was likely to have begun around
						mid-year. If that were to occur, labour market outcomes could be stronger than forecast and inflation
						would return to target more slowly. Another was if the outlook for aggregate supply proved to be more
						constrained than currently expected – for instance, if the economys current supply potential
						had been overestimated or if future productivity growth turned out to be weaker than assumed. Members
						also considered a formal analysis in which the economys supply capacity was more limited than
						currently assumed. In this case, the cash rate might need to be noticeably higher than the market path
						underpinning the August forecasts, in order to bring inflation sustainably back to target by 2026.</p>
					<p>Members observed that monetary policy could need to be tightened, even if the Boards judgements
						about consumption, the labour market and supply potential prove correct, should present financial
						conditions turn out to be insufficiently restrictive to return inflation to target. Members noted that
						the easing in financial conditions over prior months and the pick-up in credit growth made this scenario
						somewhat more plausible, as did the observation that banks were well placed to facilitate any
						strengthening in credit demand.</p>
					<p>On the other hand, members observed that there were scenarios in which future financial conditions might
						need to be less restrictive than they were at present. One such scenario was if the economy proved to be
						significantly weaker than expected and this placed more downward pressure on underlying inflation than
						expected. This could occur if households saved a significantly larger proportion of their incomes than
						currently assumed, perhaps because of earlier declines in real income and/or more persistent uncertainty.
						It could also occur if the labour market weakened more sharply than forecast. Another scenario was if
						inflation proved less persistent than assumed, even without weaker-than-expected activity. This could
						occur, for instance, if rent inflation fell more rapidly, falling petrol or other commodity prices
						materially reduced firms cost base or the decline in discretionary spending flowed through
						materially more quickly to services inflation.</p>
					<p>Members noted that each of these outcomes was conceivable given the considerable uncertainty about the
						economic outlook. Therefore, future financial conditions might need to be either tighter or looser than
						at present to achieve the Boards objectives. Members agreed that, while it was important to take
						account of economic developments abroad, it was not necessary for the cash rate target to evolve in line
						with policy rates in other economies since Australian inflation was higher, the labour market stronger
						and monetary policy less restrictive than in many other advanced economies. The exchange rate could also
						adjust as interest rate differentials between Australia and other economies evolved.</p>
					<p>In finalising the Boards statement, members agreed that it was important to convey that the Board
						remained vigilant to upside risks to inflation. They also affirmed that monetary policy would need to be
						sufficiently restrictive until members were confident that inflation was moving sustainably towards the
						target range and, based on the information available at the time of the meeting, that it was not possible
						to either rule in or rule out future changes in the cash rate target at this time. Members would rely
						upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide the Boards decisions. Returning
						inflation to target remains the Boards highest priority and it will do what is necessary to achieve
						that outcome.</p>
					<h2>The decision</h2>
					<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate target unchanged at 4.35 per cent, and the interest
						rate on Exchange Settlement balances unchanged at 4.25 per cent.</p>
