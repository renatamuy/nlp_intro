										<p><strong>Sydney – 5 and 6 February 2024</strong></p>
					<h2>Members present</h2>

						Steven Kennedy PSM, Iain Ross AO, Elana Rubin AM,
						Carol Schwartz AO, Alison Watkins AM</p>
					<h2>Others present</h2>
					<p>Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Marion Kohler (Head, Economic Analysis
						Department), Tom Rosewall (Deputy Head, Economic Analysis Department)</p>
					<p>Anthony Dickman (Secretary), David Norman (Deputy Secretary)</p>

						Carl Schwartz (Acting Head, Domestic Markets Department), Meredith Beechey Osterholm (Future
						Hub), Sally Cray (Chief Communications Officer)</p>
					<h2>International economic developments</h2>
					<p>Members began by observing that global inflation remained high but that there had been encouraging
						progress in reducing inflation towards central banks targets. Much of the easing in inflation in
						advanced economies had been due to movements in energy and goods prices. Members noted that global
						shipping costs had increased recently, partly related to attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. While this
						posed some upside risk to tradable goods inflation, the increases in shipping costs had been small
						relative to those seen during the pandemic.</p>
					<p>Compared with goods price inflation, core services price inflation had continued to ease only gradually in
						most advanced economies. Rent inflation was yet to show clear signs of easing in many economies. On the
						other hand, inflation for services other than housing had eased from its peaks, consistent with the
						gradual easing in labour market conditions and an improvement in the balance of demand and supply for
						services. However, overall services price inflation remained high relative to pre-pandemic rates.</p>
					<p>Economic growth had slowed to below-trend rates in many advanced economies in response to restrictive
						monetary policy settings. This had contributed to progress in returning inflation to target. Members
						noted that real household disposable income growth was positive in a number of advanced economies, yet
						consumption growth remained subdued. The United States was the main exception, with relatively firm
						growth in real incomes and consumption underpinning robust economic growth.</p>
					<p>GDP growth in Australias major trading partners was expected to ease in 2024. Growth in China was
						expected to slow over 2024 and 2025 as the post-pandemic rebound in consumption of services fades and the
						property sector remains weak. Weakness in these areas was expected to be partly offset by continued
						strength in manufacturing investment and further policy support for infrastructure investment. Additional
						policy measures had supported Chinese steel production and, in turn, the prices of iron ore and coking
						coal received by Australian exporters.</p>
					<h2>Domestic economic conditions</h2>
					<p>Members observed that inflation in Australia had moderated, with both headline and underlying inflation
						lower in the December quarter 2023 than had been expected three months prior. Core goods price inflation
						had declined faster than expected, as also seen abroad. Services price inflation, which largely reflects
						conditions in the domestic economy, had declined to a lesser extent and remained high. Members discussed
						how much signal to take from the faster-than-expected decline in inflation in the December quarter and
						whether goods price inflation might fall further given ongoing excess capacity in the Chinese economy.
						They also considered the implications for inflation if various subsidies that were due to expire were
						extended.</p>
					<p>Members discussed how high inflation, higher taxes and tighter monetary policy had contributed to a
						noticeable slowing in growth in aggregate demand over 2023. Looking through the volatility in monthly
						outcomes, retail sales volumes were expected to have been broadly unchanged in the December quarter.
						Retailers had reported that similar conditions had persisted into the first part of 2024. More broadly,
						weak household spending growth, particularly in per capita terms, had been only partly offset by strong
						growth in business investment and public demand. Labour market conditions had remained tight but had
						continued to ease over preceding months in response to slower economic growth. The unemployment rate and
						underemployment rate had both increased by around ½ percentage point since mid-2023, albeit from low
						levels. Overall, conditions in the labour market were assessed to be tight relative to what would be
						consistent with sustained full employment.</p>
					<p>Wages growth had remained robust, although there were signs that it was slowing in some segments of the
						labour market. Very weak productivity outcomes over the preceding years had contributed to a sharp
						increase in labour costs per unit of output. Members acknowledged that it is too soon to determine the
						extent to which a fading of the lingering disruptions from the pandemic and the adoption of artificial
						intelligence would support a turnaround in productivity growth.</p>
					<p>Members also discussed the staffs assessment of spare capacity in the economy. Estimates of
						potential output, while subject to significant uncertainty, suggested that the level of aggregate demand
						remained above the economys supply capacity. This was also consistent with other indicators of
						spare capacity, such as survey measures of utilisation, metrics from the labour market and the rate of
						inflation.</p>
					<p>Turning to the outlook, members noted that overall demand growth was expected to remain subdued in the
						near term as high inflation and earlier interest rate increases continue to weigh on household
						consumption. The near-term outlook for GDP growth had been revised down modestly from the outlook three
						months prior. This mainly reflected a weaker outlook for consumer spending, reflecting the decline in
						real incomes over recent years. As inflation moderates and real incomes start to rise from 2024,
						consumption growth was expected to recover gradually to its pre-pandemic average over 2025. Members
						considered the risk that consumers might not increase spending as real incomes begin to rise again; this
						could occur if the effect of the previous fall in real wages outweighs the support from the large stock
						of additional savings built up in 2020 and 2021 as well as the rise in housing wealth over the previous
						year. They concluded that the outlook for consumption remains a significant source of uncertainty, with
						risks to the upside and downside.</p>
					<p>Members also discussed the implications of the announced changes to the Stage 3 income tax cuts. They
						noted that the aggregate reduction in income tax payable was similar to the legislated Stage 3 tax
						cuts already incorporated in the staffs forecasts. Members were briefed on the potential for the
						different distribution of income tax reductions across households to affect the forecasts and concluded
						that the effect would be negligible for plausible assumptions about differences in marginal propensities
						to consume.</p>
					<p>Conditions in the labour market were expected to ease further over the coming year or so, to levels
						consistent with sustained full employment. Employment was expected to continue to grow moderately, though
						slower than the working-age population, and the unemployment rate and the broader underutilisation rate
						were expected to increase further. Nominal wages growth was expected to remain robust in the near term
						before moderating in response to further easing in the labour market. Members noted that the outlook for
						wages growth was consistent with the inflation target, on the assumption that productivity growth
						increases to around its long-run average.</p>
					<p>Members observed that inflation was expected to return to the target range of <span class="no-wrap">2–3</span> per cent in 2025 and to the midpoint in 2026. Inflation
						was anticipated to decline a little quicker than previously thought, because goods price inflation had
						declined more than expected and domestic demand was also a little softer than previously anticipated. But
						services inflation remained high and was still expected to decline only gradually as aggregate demand
						moderates and growth in labour and non-labour costs eases.</p>
					<h2>Financial conditions</h2>
					<p>Members noted that global financial conditions had eased over prior months.</p>
					<p>Market participants expectations for reductions in central banks policy rates had been brought
						forward since the previous meeting. This had occurred in response to lower-than-expected inflation and
						central bank communication that further policy rate increases were less likely. However, members noted
						that this had reversed in late January after a number of central bank officials stated that policy rate
						cuts were not imminent because they were looking for more evidence that low inflation would be sustained.
						Stronger-than-expected US labour market data had also pushed out market expectations for reductions in
						policy rates in the days prior to the meeting. At the time of the meeting, market pricing implied an
						expectation that advanced economy central banks would start reducing policy rates from around the middle
						of the year.</p>
					<p>Members noted that fewer reductions in the policy rate were expected in Australia than in many other
						advanced economies. Market pricing suggested that market participants believed the cash rate had probably
						reached its peak, with rate cuts of around 50 basis points expected by the end of 2024. This was
						broadly consistent with the median forecast of market economists. These expectations suggested that the
						policy rate in Australia would peak at a lower level than in a number of other advanced economies and
						decline later.</p>
					<p>Sovereign bond yields in advanced economies had declined over preceding months in response to the improved
						inflation outlook and changing expectations for the paths of central bank policy rates. Other measures of
						financial conditions had also eased. Equity prices had risen to record highs in a number of advanced
						economies, including Australia, though members noted that the gains in US share prices were narrowly
						based and valuations there looked stretched. Spreads on corporate bonds had also declined. Nonetheless,
						the demand for credit generally remained subdued. Corporate bond issuance was below average in the United
						States and Europe, especially for lower rated corporations, and credit growth in those economies remained
						low. In discussing these developments, members observed that longer term interest rates were less
						relevant for financial conditions in Australia than in economies such as the United States. Members also
						observed that corporate bond issuance was robust in Australia, in contrast to other advanced economies.
					</p>
					<p>In China, financial conditions had eased a little alongside some further policy support to address
						significant economic headwinds, including considerable stress in the property sector. Overall, the scale
						of monetary policy easing in China had been moderate, with more substantive support for the economy
						having been delivered through fiscal policy.</p>
					<p>The Australian dollar had appreciated through late 2023. This had occurred against a backdrop of general
						US dollar weakness that was underpinned by expectations of near-term cuts to the federal funds rate
						target. The Australian dollar had since depreciated as these expectations were unwound and had been
						little changed since early November. The trade-weighted Australian dollar was trading near early 2022
						levels.</p>
					<p>In Australia, financial conditions were considered to be restrictive overall. The tightening of monetary
						policy had led to a significant rise in household debt payments, which, in combination with other
						factors, was weighing on disposable incomes and consumption.</p>
					<p>Required mortgage payments had risen to a historical high as a share of household disposable income.
						Members noted this share would rise further as remaining low fixed-rate mortgages expire and roll onto
						higher rates, and the increase in the cash rate in November continues to flow through to payments. By
						contrast, a broader measure of total household debt payments (relative to disposable income) remained
						below its estimated peak, as personal credit had declined significantly since 2008. Extra payments into
						mortgage offset and redraw accounts had also declined since 2022, though they had increased in the second
						half of 2023. When viewed alongside weak consumption, this increase suggested that many borrowers might
						be responding to the incentive from higher interest rates to save more and limit their consumption.</p>
					<p>Members noted that the sharp rise in interest rates had also underpinned a large decline in credit growth
						from its peak in early 2022. Both housing and business credit growth had stabilised at a lower level over
						the preceding year. Business credit had been growing a little above its post-2008 average, while housing
						credit growth was below its average over the same period. Even so, new housing lending had picked up over
						the preceding year, consistent with the rebound in national housing prices.</p>
					<h2>Considerations for monetary policy</h2>
					<p>Turning to the policy decision, members noted that there had been further progress towards the
						Boards objectives but that more progress was required and the outlook remained uncertain.</p>
					<p>Inflation in Australia had declined but was still well above target. Members noted that the moderation in
						inflation had been driven by softer goods price inflation and that any further slowing in this component
						was likely to be modest. By contrast, services price inflation remained high and had declined only a
						little. Members observed that while some components of services inflation were unlikely to be responsive
						to monetary policy in the near term, there was still a large element that reflected excess demand.</p>
					<p>Members noted that consumption growth had remained subdued and was a little weaker than previously
						expected. The slowing in consumer spending reflected the impact on growth in real household disposable
						income of high inflation and a higher tax and interest burden. Real household disposable income was
						expected to grow in the period ahead, including because of the anticipated decline in inflation. Despite
						subdued consumption growth, overall growth in GDP remained modest, supported by a number of other parts
						of the economy that had been growing strongly. While overall growth had been modest, members agreed that
						aggregate demand was still high relative to the economys supply potential, which was generating
						inflationary pressures.</p>
					<p>Members acknowledged the significant uncertainties around the economic outlook. The most material risks
						were the potential for inflation to be more persistent than anticipated, productivity growth not to
						recover as assumed and consumption to weaken more markedly than in the staffs central forecast.
						Members noted that the staffs central forecasts were for inflation to return to the target range of
						<span class="no-wrap">2–3</span> per cent in 2025 and to the midpoint in 2026, with the
						unemployment rate rising modestly as growth in labour supply outpaces growth in employment. This was
						predicated, however, on inflation expectations remaining anchored around the midpoint of the target range
						and some assumed recovery in productivity. Members considered the policy implications of a scenario in
						which inflation expectations instead gradually drift up and another where consumption is materially
						weaker than in the central forecasts.</p>
					<p>Members discussed the extent of the tightness in financial conditions. They noted that financial
						conditions appeared to be quite restrictive on some measures, but less restrictive on others. Members
						observed that this is consistent with growth in activity varying quite significantly across parts of the
						economy.</p>
					<p>In light of these observations, members considered whether to raise the cash rate target by a further
						25 basis points at this meeting or to leave it unchanged.</p>
					<p>The case to raise the cash rate further centred on the observation that it would take some time for
						inflation to return to target and the labour market to full employment. Inflation was expected to take a
						further two years or so to return towards the midpoint of the target range under the central forecast.
						This was consistent with the staffs assessment that aggregate demand remains above the
						economys supply potential. Members noted that an increase in the cash rate target at this meeting
						could slow the growth of demand further and reduce the risk of inflation not returning to target in an
						acceptable timeframe. Increasing the cash rate target now would not prevent the Board from easing
						monetary policy if the economy were to weaken more sharply than envisaged.</p>
					<p>The case to leave the cash rate target unchanged at this meeting centred on the observation that the risk
						of inflation not returning to the Boards target within a reasonable timeframe had eased. The
						moderation in inflation over preceding months had been slightly larger than previously expected, and
						global inflation outcomes had provided additional confidence that inflation in Australia would moderate
						further. Data on the labour market and consumer spending had also been weaker than previously expected.
						Members noted that it was possible that conditions in the labour market were already consistent with full
						employment, although this was judged to be unlikely.</p>
					<p>Members noted that the staffs central forecasts were for inflation to return to target within the
						timeframe that they had previously concluded was acceptable, and for conditions in the labour market to
						be broadly consistent with full employment in a year or so. Both of these forecasts were predicated on a
						technical assumption for the cash rate, derived from market economists forecasts and market
						pricing, that include no additional increase in the cash rate. Members observed that the risks around the
						outlook were broadly balanced; there was a risk that inflation proves more persistent but there was also
						a risk that consumer spending weakens more sharply than it had to date. Given these observations, it was
						reasonable to conclude that leaving the cash rate unchanged at this meeting, and continuing to monitor
						how risks to the outlook evolve, was the most appropriate course of action.</p>
					<p>In weighing up these two options, members judged that the case to leave the cash rate target unchanged was
						the stronger one. They agreed that doing so would best balance the Boards objectives for price
						stability and full employment. Members noted that the data had evolved in a manner that gave them more
						confidence that inflation would return to target within a reasonable timeframe while allowing employment
						to continue to grow.</p>
					<p>Members then considered the options for how to communicate the Boards decision in the post-meeting
						statement. They agreed to communicate that there had been progress towards meeting the Boards
						inflation objective. At the same time, members noted that it would take some time before they could have
						sufficient confidence that inflation would return to target within a reasonable timeframe. Uncertainty
						about the outlook for the economy was high. Members also observed that the costs of inflation not
						returning to target within the envisaged timeframe were potentially very high. Given this, members agreed
						that it was appropriate not to rule out a further increase in the cash rate target. They also agreed that
						it would be important to continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in
						domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. Members reiterated their resolve to
						do what is necessary to return inflation to target.</p>
					<p>In light of these conclusions, members agreed that it was important for the Boards public statement
						to make clear that inflation had moderated but was still high, and that it was not yet possible to rule
						in or out further increases in interest rates. Members also agreed on the importance of highlighting the
						uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook and the need for monetary policy to be driven by
						developments in relevant data, the outlook for the economy and the evolving risks.</p>
					<h2>The decision</h2>
					<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate target unchanged at 4.35 per cent, and the interest
						rate on Exchange Settlement balances unchanged at 4.25 per cent.</p>
