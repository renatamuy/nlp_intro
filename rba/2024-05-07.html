					<h1 class="page-title">Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board</h1>

										<p><strong>Sydney – 6 and 7 May 2024</strong></p>
					<h2>Members present</h2>
					<p>Michele Bullock (Governor and Chair), Andrew Hauser (Deputy Governor), Ian Harper AO,
						Carolyn Hewson AO, Steven Kennedy PSM, Iain Ross AO,
						Elana Rubin AM, Carol Schwartz AO, Alison Watkins AM</p>
					<h2>Others present</h2>
					<p>Sarah Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial
						Markets)</p>
					<p>Anthony Dickman (Secretary), David Norman (Deputy Secretary)</p>
					<p>Meredith Beechey Osterholm (Future Hub), Sally Cray (Chief Communications Officer),
						Marion Kohler (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Carl Schwartz (Acting Head, Domestic
						Markets Department), Penelope Smith (Head, International Department)</p>
					<h2>International economic conditions</h2>
					<p>Members began their discussion of international economic conditions by noting that the risks to global
						growth had become more balanced over prior weeks. While national accounts measures of growth in most
						advanced economies had remained weak, some forward-looking indicators had been more positive. The United
						States was the exception, where growth had been robust and had moderated only a little in 2024 compared
						with the very strong rates of 2023. The US labour market had been surprisingly strong over preceding
						months and labour markets in most other advanced economies remained tight, despite further gradual
						easing.</p>
					<p>Inflation in advanced economies remained above central banks targets, despite substantial declines,
						and progress in lowering inflation appeared to have stalled, in some cases at least temporarily. Core
						services price inflation remained high and the latest US inflation data had surprised on the upside.
						Members discussed how more persistent services price inflation could delay the return of inflation to
						target, particularly in those countries where signs were emerging that disinflation in core goods prices
						may have run its course.</p>
					<p>Economic growth had picked up in China early in the year and appeared to be on track to reach the growth
						target for 2024 of around 5 per cent. Some of this strength was attributable to a
						rise in net exports. Members noted, however, that conditions in the property market remained very weak
						and that policy support would still be needed to offset the resulting drag on GDP growth. The prices of
						iron ore, coking coal and base metals had all risen since the previous meeting, due to some combination
						of a stronger economic outlook for China and constrained supply. The staff forecast for trade-weighted
						growth in Australias major trading partners had been little changed since the February meeting;
						while near-term forecasts for output growth in the United States and China had been revised higher,
						forecasts for some other trading partners had been revised downwards.</p>
					<h2>Domestic economic conditions</h2>
					<p>Consumer spending had continued to be weaker than expected in the first quarter of 2024. By contrast, real
						household disposable income had started to stabilise at a somewhat higher level than had been
						anticipated. The developments indicated that households were maintaining a higher rate of saving than had
						been expected. Members noted that a small share of households were curtailing their spending in the face
						of income constraints, but many others were simply choosing to reduce their spending. They debated the
						relative importance of higher returns on savings and greater-than-usual uncertainty among households in
						driving this outcome, noting that this was a key judgement for the outlook for output and inflation.</p>
					<p>Both business investment and public sector spending had been growing strongly. Private non-residential
						construction and investment in software and other forms of intangibles had been important contributors to
						overall growth in business investment. Members acknowledged that it was not possible to determine
						accurately the shares of such investment intended to enhance productivity (e.g. artificial intelligence),
						mitigate risks (e.g. cybersecurity) or meet compliance obligations, though the economic implications of
						each would be different.</p>
					<p>Labour market conditions had eased by less than had been anticipated three months earlier. The
						unemployment rate was still only modestly above its late-2022 trough. The participation rate and
						employment-to-population ratio also remained near record high levels, though average hours worked and job
						vacancies had both declined further. Demand was strongest for skilled labour and in government-related
						sectors. Members debated why employment growth was proving so resilient, noting that this could reflect
						decisions to hoard labour, marginal workers being less productive, persistently strong population growth,
						the current composition of demand or a difference in the outlook for spending among consumers and
						businesses. Different weightings on these factors would imply different implications for the economic
						outlook.</p>
					<p>Members discussed the degree of spare capacity in the economy, which was a key judgement required for the
						outlook. They noted the staffs assessment that the level of demand exceeded supply at the end of
						2023, though the gap had narrowed relatively quickly owing to subdued growth; it was also noted that such
						measures are subject to material uncertainty. Conditions in the labour market appeared to be tighter than
						those consistent with full employment, drawing on historical comparisons for a range of labour market
						indicators, model-based estimates and information from business surveys. Members discussed the
						implications of developments in wages and productivity for their assessment of the level of full
						employment.</p>
					<p>Inflation had eased further in the March quarter in year-ended terms, but the pace of disinflation had
						slowed and the recent inflation data were stronger than had been expected in February. Both domestic
						labour and non-labour cost pressures remained high. Goods price inflation had eased further over prior
						months, but the pass-through of the earlier easing in import price growth to domestic consumer prices now
						appeared to be largely complete. Services price inflation had peaked but remained high, particularly for
						services that are less discretionary. Growth in unit labour costs remained high but had moderated
						slightly, in line with the recent increase in labour productivity growth.</p>
					<h2>Financial conditions</h2>
					<p>Market participants expectations for the path of central bank policy rates had risen noticeably
						since the March meeting. This had been particularly pronounced in the United States and Australia, where
						recent inflation data had been higher than expected. While market pricing still implied that policy rates
						had reached a peak in many advanced economies, the expected timing of future reductions in policy rates
						had been pushed out, to later in 2024 in most cases. As expected, the Bank of Japan had raised its policy
						rate shortly after the March meeting and had announced an end to its yield curve control and several of
						its asset-purchasing programs.</p>
					<p>Sovereign bond yields in most advanced economies had increased since the previous meeting. This was
						consistent with changes in market expectations for policy rates and a modest increase in financial market
						measures of inflation expectations in some countries. The easing in some other measures of global
						financial conditions since late 2023 remained in place. In particular, a range of risk asset prices,
						including equity prices, were still high. Corporate bond yields had risen, but by less than government
						bond yields, and conditions in international wholesale funding markets remained favourable. Members
						observed that such pricing was indicative of investors expecting benign economic outcomes.</p>
					<p>The Australian dollar had appreciated a little since the previous meeting. This was consistent with a
						modest widening of yield differentials between Australia and other advanced economies and a recovery in
						commodity prices. On a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar had been supported by the depreciation
						of the yen and the renminbi.</p>
					<p>Members considered overall financial conditions in Australia to be restrictive, particularly for
						households. They noted that the cash rate was above most estimates derived from a range of models of the
						so-called neutral rate – the level consistent with monetary policy being neither
						expansionary nor contractionary. However, members acknowledged the considerable uncertainty around
						estimates of the neutral rate, which make it difficult to draw strong conclusions about the scale of this
						effect. They considered various developments that may have raised the neutral rate in recent years, while
						also noting that most of the structural factors that were linked to lowering the neutral rate over the
						preceding decade had not changed. Members also observed that several household financial indicators were
						consistent with financial conditions being significantly tighter than the average of the preceding
						15 years, while the results of a comparison of business financial indicators were mixed.</p>
					<p>Household debt payments had continued to rise as a share of household income. Scheduled mortgage payments
						had increased further as fixed-rate loans continued to roll onto higher rates. Nonetheless, extra
						payments by mortgage holders had also increased as a share of disposable income, to be slightly above the
						pre-pandemic average. This was consistent with households saving more, potentially in response to higher
						interest rates, thereby contributing to the weakness in consumption growth.</p>
					<p>Market pricing implied that the cash rate was not expected to be reduced over the year
						ahead. Indeed, market pricing pointed to around a 40 per cent chance of one
						further rate increase in 2024, with reductions in the cash rate seen as likely in 2025. Relative to
						several other advanced economies, market participants expected fewer cuts in Australia, and for these
						cuts to begin later. Expectations for the level of the cash rate in Australia at the end of 2025,
						however, were comparable to those for other advanced economies. On average, market economists expected
						the RBA to begin cutting the cash rate one or two quarters earlier than implied by market pricing,
						although some market economists had also noted the possibility of an increase in the cash rate in coming
						months.</p>
					<h2>Economic outlook</h2>
					<p>Members noted that the staff forecasts were for a period of subdued demand growth during the remainder of
						2024, bringing aggregate demand closer to balance with the economys supply potential. The output
						gap was projected to close more slowly than it had in 2023. A key assumption in the forecasts was that
						the household savings rate would continue to rise in 2024 and consumption growth would recover more
						slowly than previously forecast. Members discussed the potential for both weaker outcomes (if the labour
						market weakened more than expected) or stronger outcomes (if households spent more of the unanticipated
						additional savings that had built up during the pandemic period).</p>
					<p>Members noted that the  labour market was projected to continue easing, though the easing
						was now expected to take longer than previously thought. Unemployment was expected to be around the level
						consistent with the Boards full employment mandate by mid-2025.</p>
					<p>As in the February forecasts, inflation was expected to reach the target range of <span class="no-wrap">2–3</span> per cent in the second half of 2025 and the midpoint in
						2026, though this was predicated on a noticeably higher technical assumption for the cash rate than three
						months earlier. The near-term profile for CPI inflation was somewhat higher than in the February forecast
						because of the March quarter outcome, a more gradual projected easing in labour market capacity and
						higher petrol prices. Members observed that the forecasts did not incorporate any measures that may be
						announced in the forthcoming federal and state budgets for <span class="no-wrap">2024/25</span>.</p>
					<p>Noting the staffs assessment that the risks to the domestic outlook were broadly balanced around the
						central forecasts, members considered scenarios that illustrated the implications of uncertainty around
						the level of full employment. These showed that inflation may not return to the target range over the
						forecast period if the labour market were to be tighter than assumed in the projections; on the other
						hand, there would be excess unemployment over this period and a faster decline in inflation if the labour
						market were to have more capacity than assumed. These scenarios illustrated that, while the risks
						may be balanced, the costs associated with them could be asymmetric because inflation was
						already projected to be above target for several years in the central forecast. Members observed that the
						implications for inflation would be qualitatively similar if trend productivity deviated from the
						assumption underlying the forecasts, and that these scenarios highlighted the importance of monitoring
						early warning indicators for economic activity, the labour market and inflation.</p>
					<h2>Considerations for monetary policy</h2>
					<p>Turning to considerations for the policy decision, members noted that most of the data received since the
						previous meeting had been stronger than expected. Taken together, these data suggested that there may be
						somewhat less slack in the economy than previously assessed. Inflation in Australia had declined more
						slowly than anticipated. Conditions in the labour market had eased by less than expected over prior
						months and were tighter than those consistent with full employment. Internationally, the data for both
						economic growth and inflation had also tended to exceed expectations, and the near-term outlook for
						output growth in some major economies had improved. The key exception to this trend of
						stronger-than-expected data related to consumer spending in Australia, where the data had signalled
						ongoing weakness into 2024.</p>
					<p>Financial conditions in Australia were judged to be restrictive. Expectations for the future path of
						policy rates had increased both domestically and in the United States, and financial conditions had
						tightened in response. Market pricing no longer implied a reduction in the cash rate in 2024, and the
						Australian dollar had appreciated modestly, though remained within its recent range.</p>
					<p>Members noted that the staff forecasts still had inflation returning to target within the same timeframe
						as expected in February, but that this was predicated on a technical assumption for the cash rate that
						was noticeably higher than previously assumed. The forecasts were for output growth to remain subdued in
						2024, bringing aggregate demand and supply into closer balance. Labour market conditions were forecast to
						moderate gradually, and the unemployment rate was expected to be consistent with full employment by
						mid-2025.</p>
					<p>Members discussed the key judgements in the staff forecasts. These were: consumption growth would remain
						weak for most of 2024, despite the stronger outlook for growth in income and wealth, which have been the
						key determinants of consumption in the past; there was now somewhat less spare capacity in the labour
						market than previously assumed, given the unexpectedly gradual easing of conditions; and inflation would
						continue to moderate, despite recent information signalling more persistence than previously assessed. If
						these judgements prove wrong, the forecasts for inflation and the labour market would need to be
						materially altered.</p>
					<p>Members reviewed the strategy adopted by the Board over the preceding two years. This involved setting
						monetary policy to return inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe while supporting a gradual
						adjustment of labour market conditions to full employment. The strategy balanced the risk of inflation
						expectations drifting higher against the risk of inducing a pronounced rise in unemployment. Members
						recognised that there were significant costs associated with both risks and agreed that the strategy of
						seeking to balance the two remained appropriate. However, they expressed limited tolerance for inflation
						returning to target later than 2026.</p>
					<p>Given these observations, members considered their decision on the cash rate.</p>
					<p>Raising the cash rate at this meeting could be appropriate if the Board formed a view that the judgements
						underpinning the staff forecasts risked being overly optimistic about the forces that would drive down
						inflation, leaving the balance of risks tilted to the upside. The flow of data since the previous meeting
						had mostly been stronger than expected. The forecasts had also placed significant weight on the downside
						risks to consumption. Against that view, it was possible that consumer spending could pick up somewhat
						more rapidly if labour market outcomes remained benign, real household disposable income were to recover
						and balance sheets remained relatively strong for most households. If accompanied by further growth in
						public demand and business investment, this could sustain aggregate demand above the economys
						supply potential and delay the return of inflation to target.</p>
					<p>A higher cash rate might also be required, even with ongoing weakness in aggregate demand, if other
						factors slowed the pace of disinflation. Members observed that this could occur if trend productivity
						growth turned out to be weaker than assumed, unless wages growth were to moderate in response. A drift
						higher in inflation expectations, should it occur, would also make it more costly to return inflation to
						target.</p>
					<p>By contrast, the case to hold the cash rate steady at this meeting was premised on the view that, while
						there had been notable updates on the state of the economy since the previous meeting, the updates had
						not been sufficient to warrant a change in the stance of monetary policy. Inflation was still declining
						towards the target and the recent information did not materially alter its trajectory. Furthermore, the
						forecasts showed a credible path by which the Board could meet its objectives in a timeframe that was
						consistent with the Boards strategy. These forecasts were underpinned by key judgements that were
						considered sound and resulted in a balanced set of risks around the central forecasts.</p>
					<p>Holding the cash rate steady could also be an appropriate way to mitigate the risk that future demand
						growth turned out to be slower than envisaged in the forecasts, bringing inflation back to target more
						quickly than assumed and pushing unemployment well above the level consistent with full employment. That
						could come about, for example, if consumer spending remained subdued for a more prolonged period as the
						labour market softened, in turn dampening business investment and hiring. In that scenario, the current
						path of the cash rate implied by financial markets could turn out to be too high. Similarly, members
						observed that there is uncertainty about the rate of unemployment that is consistent with full
						employment. Holding the cash rate steady could be an appropriate way to mitigate the risk that the labour
						market is already close to full employment, which would bring inflation back to target somewhat sooner
						than envisaged.</p>
					<p>In weighing up these options, members judged that the case to leave the cash rate unchanged at this
						meeting was the stronger one. They agreed that the flow of information since the previous meeting had
						increased the risks of inflation staying above target for longer. However, members considered that the
						staff forecasts presented a credible path back to the inflation target, with the risks surrounding the
						forecasts judged to be balanced. Importantly, inflation expectations remained well anchored. Given this,
						and the higher-than-usual level of uncertainty about the economic outlook, members judged that it
						remained reasonable to look through short-term variation in inflation to avoid excessive fine-tuning.</p>
					<p>In finalising the Boards statement, members agreed that it was important to convey that recent data
						and other information had signalled that the risks around inflation had risen somewhat. They also agreed
						that returning inflation to target remained the Boards highest priority. This process was unlikely
						to be smooth and members recognised the considerable uncertainty about the outlook for both inflation and
						the labour market. Given this, members agreed that it was difficult either to rule in or rule out future
						changes in the cash rate target. They reiterated their resolve to do what is necessary to return
						inflation to target, and to continue paying close attention to developments in the global economy, trends
						in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market.</p>
					<h2>The decision</h2>
					<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate target unchanged at 4.35 per cent, and the interest
						rate on Exchange Settlement balances unchanged at 4.25 per cent.</p>
