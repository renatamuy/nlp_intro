					<h1 class="page-title">Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board</h1>

										<p><strong>Sydney – 5 and 6 August 2024</strong></p>
					<h2>Members present</h2>

						Carolyn Hewson AO, Steven Kennedy PSM, Iain Ross AO,
						Elana Rubin AM, Alison Watkins AM</p>

						<cite>Reserve Bank Act 1959</cite>.</p>
					<h2>Others present</h2>
					<p>Sarah Hunter (Assistant Governor, Economic), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Financial
						Markets)</p>
					<p>Anthony Dickman (Secretary), David Norman (Deputy Secretary)</p>
					<p>Meredith Beechey Osterholm (Future Hub), Sally Cray (Chief Communications Officer),
						Natasha Cassidy (Deputy Head, Economic Analysis Department), Carl Schwartz (Acting Head,
						Domestic Markets Department), Penelope Smith (Head, International Department)</p>
					<h2>Economic conditions</h2>
					<p>Members began their discussion by considering developments in aggregate demand. Domestic demand had been a
						little stronger in early 2024 than had been expected in May, driven by household and public consumption.
						That said, household consumption growth remained well below pre-pandemic averages, even after the upward
						revisions to consumption from mid-2022 to the end of 2023, as discussed at the June meeting. The upside
						surprise in domestic demand had also occurred alongside robust growth in imports, leaving GDP growth
						somewhat lower than expected in the March quarter.</p>
					<p>The available data suggested that household consumption had declined further on a per capita basis in the
						June quarter, but that the pre-conditions for a gradual pick-up in consumption growth remained in place.
						Real disposable incomes had stabilised earlier in the year and were expected to increase; prior strong
						growth in household net wealth would also provide some support to household consumption. There had been
						limited and preliminary indications that consumer confidence had increased a little in July following the
						implementation of the Stage 3 tax cuts. However, some households remained under significant
						financial pressure, particularly those with limited or no financial buffers. Members discussed the
						potential implications of varying trends in income and wealth.</p>
					<p>Conditions in residential construction remained challenging. New dwelling supply had weakened, and ongoing
						cost pressures and labour shortages were constraining how quickly the pipeline of residential projects
						could be worked through. The shortage of labour was due, in part, to competition for workers from high
						levels of non-residential building activity. Liaison contacts expected activity on both detached homes
						and new apartments to slow over the year ahead, given the ongoing cost pressures and the subdued flow of
						new dwelling approvals. While there was still strong growth in underlying demand for housing, this had
						diminished slightly as the average household size had increased, possibly in response to higher rents and
						housing prices.</p>
					<p>Labour market conditions in the June quarter had continued to ease gradually. The unemployment rate had
						increased a little but remained only modestly above its late-2022 trough. Members noted that the rise in
						the unemployment rate owed more to reduced flows of workers into employment than an increase in layoffs,
						which remained very low. Both the participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio remained
						high, and average hours worked had been a little higher than previously expected. Members also observed
						that the level of job vacancies remained well above both its pre-pandemic average and outcomes in other
						advanced economies, despite falling significantly from its peak. Many firms continued to report that
						finding suitable labour is an ongoing challenge.</p>
					<p>Members discussed the June quarter inflation data, which were broadly in line with the forecast in May.
						Underlying inflation had eased a little, but in quarterly terms the outcome was not much lower than it
						was a year earlier. Inflation in prices of market services had eased in the June quarter but remained
						high, given persistently strong growth in both labour and domestic non-labour costs. Members discussed
						trends in inflation for items whose prices are either regulated or partially indexed to past inflation,
						which collectively account for about one-quarter of the CPI basket. They noted that while overall
						inflation in these items had been high, this was consistent with historical experience. By contrast,
						inflation in the remainder of the CPI basket had been well above its historical average.</p>
					<p>Members discussed the degree of spare capacity in the economy, which was a key judgement underpinning the
						staff forecasts. Based on the data and evidence over a period of time, the staff had assessed that the
						economy had less spare capacity than previously assumed. This reflected higher inflation outcomes over
						the preceding <span class="no-wrap">12–18</span> months than could be explained by previous
						estimates of excess demand, and signals from labour market indicators and survey measures of capacity
						utilisation. Members discussed the considerable uncertainty around estimates of spare capacity and the
						need to reassess this judgement regularly as the data evolve.</p>
					<h2>Economic outlook</h2>
					<p>Members noted that the staff forecast for GDP growth over the year ahead had been revised higher. This was
						driven by an upward revision to the forecast for domestic final demand as the outlook for both household
						consumption and public demand had strengthened. Household consumption growth was expected to pick up in
						the second half of 2024, supported by an increase in real income growth from the Stage 3 tax cuts
						and declining inflation, as well as higher wealth. By contrast, the expected recovery in dwelling
						investment was now forecast to occur a little later than previously assumed. Despite the upward
						revisions, growth in GDP was still projected to remain below growth in aggregate supply for a period,
						bringing the economy to a more balanced state and thereby reducing inflationary pressure. However,
						considerable uncertainty around this judgement remained.</p>
					<p>The labour market was expected to continue to ease gradually before stabilising in early 2026, consistent
						with the signal from leading indicators of labour demand such as job vacancies and hiring intentions. The
						forecast increase in the unemployment rate was consistent with the anticipated mildness of the downturn.
						The staff expected that the adjustment to slowing demand would continue to occur, in part, through lower
						average hours. Members discussed a scenario prepared by the staff in which the unemployment rate picked
						up more sharply, as had been the case in some peer economies, returning inflation to target sooner. They
						noted that this would be more likely to occur if businesses were currently hoarding labour. While the
						evidence that this was occurring seemed limited, members were alert to the possibility that labour demand
						could soften, perhaps quite rapidly.</p>
					<p>Wages growth was judged to be past its peak and was expected to slow gradually as the labour market eased.
						Members debated how far – and how rapidly – wages growth would slow, and the implications of
						this for inflation, given the easing in the labour market, the structure of recent enterprise bargaining
						agreements and the declines in real wages since 2021. They also noted the need for productivity growth to
						recover in order to help reduce growth in unit labour costs. Members discussed the potential causes of
						the weakness in productivity growth since the pandemic, the impact of changes to industry composition and
						explanations for why productivity outcomes had been much stronger in the United States than elsewhere.
					</p>
					<p>The forecast for underlying inflation had been revised higher since May. This reflected the stronger
						forecast for aggregate demand and the staffs judgement that potential supply in the economy was
						less than previously assessed. As such, the forecast return to the inflation target range of <span class="no-wrap">2–3</span> per cent was expected to be a little later than
						anticipated in May, and the central forecast had inflation approaching the midpoint in 2026. Headline
						inflation was expected to dip temporarily below 3 per cent in the year ahead, owing to new and
						extended electricity rebates and rent assistance, but then rebound following the legislated unwinding of
						some of these policies in mid-2025.</p>
					<p>Members observed that a range of uncertainties could influence the outlook for inflation, including the
						evolution of the labour market, household saving behaviour and the extent of spare capacity, as well as
						global geopolitical developments. Members also noted the uncertainty surrounding future population
						growth. While requirements for offshore student visa applications had been tightened and the government
						had proposed caps on international student numbers, past population growth had surprised on the upside.
						Members noted, however, that the impact of population growth on inflation is not straightforward as it
						affects both aggregate demand and supply capacity.</p>
					<h2>Financial conditions</h2>
					<p>Members discussed developments in global financial markets and the significant bout of volatility
						prevailing at the time of the meeting.</p>
					<p>Members noted that several advanced economy central banks – including the Bank of Canada, the Bank
						of England, the European Central Bank and the Sveriges Riksbank – had lowered their policy rates in
						recent months. Market participants expected other central banks – including the US Federal Reserve
						and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand – to do likewise at coming meetings. This reflected progress on
						returning inflation to central banks targets and a softening in labour market conditions in several
						advanced economies. By contrast, the Bank of Japan had increased its policy rate and accelerated the
						process of balance sheet reduction, citing greater confidence that it would sustainably achieve its
						2 per cent inflation target.</p>
					<p>Members observed that the publication of weaker-than-expected US payroll data for July had triggered
						significant volatility in global financial markets. These data had caused market participants to expect a
						much faster pace of policy easing by the US Federal Reserve and some other central banks. Market
						sentiment had also been affected by a range of other factors, including US corporate financial results,
						questions about the optimistic valuations of some large technology companies, concerns about rising
						geopolitical tensions and investors portfolio adjustments. Government bond yields in most advanced
						economies had declined in response to the revised expectations for central bank policy rates. Risk asset
						prices, including for equities, had also fallen as markets reassessed the outlook for growth in advanced
						economies; this had followed a period of strong appetite for risk in financial markets, which had
						prompted increases in equity prices in May and June, in some cases to record highs.</p>
					<p>The declines in global equity prices had been most notable in Japan. In large part, this reflected the
						significant appreciation of the yen in response to a narrowing of interest rate differentials between
						Japan and the rest of the world, which was weighing on the earnings outlook for Japanese exporters. It
						had also reflected an associated unwinding of so-called carry trades, whereby market
						participants borrow in yen at low interest rates to invest in higher yielding assets denominated in other
						currencies. The unwinding of yen carry trades was likely to be amplifying the decline in riskier asset
						prices globally.</p>
					<p>Members noted that, at the time of the meeting, it was too soon to tell where financial markets would
						eventually settle. Most markets had continued to function well, and there were early indications that
						conditions had begun to stabilise.</p>
					<p>In China, authorities had eased monetary policy modestly amid weak demand for credit, slowing economic
						activity and an uncertain economic outlook. Chinese Government bond yields had declined to historical
						lows and credit demand had eased further, particularly from households, as the protracted contraction in
						the property sector continued to weigh on the sentiment of consumers and home buyers. The authorities had
						continued to direct lending towards priority sectors – such as science, technology and
						manufacturing – which had helped to offset some of the impact of the property sector contraction on
						commodity prices.</p>
					<p>The Australian dollar had depreciated on a trade-weighted basis since the previous meeting but remained
						within the range of recent years. A widening of interest rate differentials between Australia and other
						major advanced economies had supported the Australian dollar in early July. However, the appreciation had
						unwound amid the more recent deterioration in risk sentiment, liquidation of Australian dollar positions
						related to Japanese yen carry trades and declines in some key commodity prices. Members discussed the
						materiality of these recent market movements and observed that, if sustained, they could limit the pace
						of disinflation.</p>
					<p>For Australia, members observed that financial conditions appeared to be less restrictive than had
						previously been the case. While the cash rate remained above estimates of the neutral rate, market
						participants had lowered their expectations for the path of the cash rate and there had been associated
						declines in bond yields. Housing credit growth had gradually increased, suggesting households had been
						more willing to borrow. Meanwhile, business credit growth had picked up and was well above its average
						since the global financial crisis. Funding conditions more generally for Australian financial and
						non-financial corporations remained favourable.</p>
					<p>Members discussed conditions facing smaller businesses, including information from the Banks 32nd
						annual Small Business Finance Advisory Panel in July. When combined with information from the liaison
						program and from economic indicators and surveys, it was affirmed that conditions for small businesses
						were somewhat weaker than those for larger firms. Business insolvencies had increased, including for
						medium-sized enterprises, though were still below their pre-pandemic trend. Panellists reported that
						financial conditions generally had tightened over the prior year, mainly because of stricter lending
						standards. Bank lending to small businesses had not increased for some years.</p>
					<p>Market expectations for the cash rate had moved materially in the run-up to the meeting, including falling
						in response to the June quarter CPI release and the shift in expectations for US monetary policy. Market
						pricing implied an expectation that the cash rate would be reduced by the end of the year.</p>
					<h2>Considerations for monetary policy</h2>
					<p>Turning to considerations for the policy decision, members noted that several developments over preceding
						months had supported the view that inflation would be slow to decline. Underlying inflation had fallen
						very little over the prior year in quarterly terms and, while the June quarter outcome had been in line
						with the staffs forecast, inflation was still some way above target. The revised forecast was for
						inflation to take a little longer than previously thought to return sustainably to target. Members noted
						that there had also been a pattern since early 2023 of both Bank and market-implied forecasts modestly
						underpredicting inflation a few quarters in advance.</p>
					<p>GDP growth remained weak, especially in per capita terms, and the labour market had continued to ease over
						prior months. Even so, domestic final demand had been stronger than expected over the year to the March
						quarter, employment growth was still strong and some firms continued to report that labour shortages were
						a constraint on output. The staffs forecast for GDP growth had been revised higher since May.
						Members observed that two key judgements underpinned the forecast: that consumption growth would recover
						in line with its historical relationships with income and wealth; and that the labour market would
						continue to ease gradually but stabilise as GDP growth picks up. Members also discussed a third key
						judgement: that the gap between aggregate demand and supply was somewhat larger than previously assessed.
						They observed that the outlook for inflation and conditions in the labour market could be materially
						different if any of these judgements proved to be mistaken.</p>
					<p>Members noted that the volatility in financial markets prevailing at the time of the meeting appeared to
						reflect a combination of market participants reassessing the outlook for US (and hence global) demand,
						and a partial unwinding of asset valuations that, for certain sectors, had been viewed as optimistic.
						Whether the adjustments in market prices would persist, however, and their implications for financial
						conditions were unclear.</p>
					<p>In light of these developments, members assessed that the risk of inflation not returning to target within
						a reasonable timeframe had increased. This reflected the slow pace of disinflation over the preceding
						year, the staffs judgement that the gap between aggregate demand and supply was larger than
						previously assessed, and the upward revision to the forecast for final demand. Members affirmed that
						their strategy was still to bring inflation back to target within a reasonable timeframe and their
						tolerance for this timeframe being pushed out further was limited. That said, members noted that the
						forecasts were uncertain. Importantly, they were also based on a conditioning assumption, derived from
						market expectations, that the cash rate would be lowered several times in the coming year, beginning
						later in 2024. Based on what they knew at the time of the meeting, members agreed that monetary policy
						would need to be tighter than this implied path in order to bring inflation sustainably back to target
						within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
					<p>Given these observations, members considered their decision on the cash rate.</p>
					<p>Raising the cash rate target at this meeting could be appropriate if members judged that the risk that
						inflation would not return to target in a reasonable timeframe had materially increased, either because
						of economic developments or because financial conditions were insufficiently tight.</p>
					<p>Members discussed several developments that could suggest the risk of inflation not returning to the
						target range by late 2025 had risen materially. Underlying inflation was proving persistent and the
						central projection was now for inflation to return to target somewhat later than previously forecast.
						Members also noted that the persistence of cost pressures was a key theme reported by firms in liaison
						discussions. In addition, the staffs assessment was that the gap between aggregate demand and
						supply would be wider than previously judged throughout the forecast period, because of both a stronger
						outlook for demand and a reassessment of the economys current spare capacity. Members noted that
						judgements about this gap were highly uncertain. However, they observed that both model- and survey-based
						estimates pointed to the level of aggregate demand exceeding supply, and that some estimates implied that
						the gap was larger than currently assessed. Given members agreed commitment to prioritise returning
						inflation to target, these observations could justify an immediate increase in the cash rate.</p>
					<p>The case to raise the cash rate could be further supported by developments in financial conditions over
						preceding months. Members noted that financial conditions appeared to have eased modestly, as housing
						prices and credit growth had picked up and bond yields had declined. The staffs forecasts also
						implied that the future path for the cash rate inferred from market pricing was not sufficient to return
						inflation to the midpoint of the target range in 2026. The volatility in financial markets complicated
						this assessment, but members judgement at the time of the meeting was that the volatility would not
						have a material effect. Collectively, these considerations could be taken to imply that monetary policy
						should be tighter to achieve the Boards inflation objective.</p>
					<p>By contrast, holding the cash rate steady at this meeting – and possibly for an extended period
						– would be appropriate if members assessed that inflation was still broadly on track to return to
						target within a reasonable timeframe. It could also be appropriate if the current level of the cash rate
						was judged to be appropriate to balance the prevailing risks to inflation with those surrounding the
						outlook for the labour market.</p>
					<p>Members observed that while underlying inflation was still too high and had fallen only slightly over the
						prior year, the disinflation in the June quarter had been broadly based across price categories.
						Inflation was still forecast to decline further as conditions in the labour market eased, and the pace of
						disinflation would be faster if the staff had overestimated the extent of excess demand. Members observed
						that there was considerable uncertainty about the inflation outlook and that inflation was forecast to
						return to the target range even in scenarios that incorporated a stronger outlook for consumption than in
						the central forecast. In addition, the forecast for when inflation would return to target was conditioned
						on the cash rate being reduced several times over coming years, including later this year. Members
						observed that it was possible to achieve a comparable degree of tightening in financial conditions as an
						increase in the cash rate by holding the cash rate at its current level for longer than the technical
						conditioning assumption underpinning the forecasts.</p>
					<p>The case to hold the cash rate steady at this meeting was further supported by the need to balance the
						risks to the inflation forecast with those surrounding the outlook for full employment. Members noted
						that it was uncertain whether the forecast pick-up in domestic demand would materialise, given
						uncertainty around the staffs judgements on consumption and the outlook for the labour market.
						Members noted that scenarios in which either consumption per capita did not grow or in which the
						unemployment rate increases by more than expected would see inflation return to target sooner than in the
						central forecast (though possibly still quite gradually). Given this, and the high degree of uncertainty
						surrounding both the forecasts and the implications of the volatility in financial markets prevailing at
						the time of the meeting, it could be that holding the cash rate steady best balanced the risks
						surrounding the outlook for both inflation and the labour market.</p>
					<p>After weighing up these alternatives, members decided that the case to leave the cash rate target
						unchanged at this meeting was the stronger one. They agreed that doing so would best balance the risks to
						both inflation and the labour market, particularly in light of the prevailing uncertainties, market
						volatility and market expectations. Members noted that it was appropriate to continue placing somewhat
						greater-than-usual weight on the flow of data, relative to the forecasts, when there were uncertainties
						about the persistence of supply shocks. In addition, the flow of data since the previous meeting had not
						been sufficient to warrant a change in the stance of monetary policy. Members also observed that holding
						the cash rate target steady at its current level for a longer period than currently implied by market
						pricing may be sufficient to return inflation to target in a reasonable timeframe, but that the Board
						will need to reassess this possibility at future meetings.</p>
					<p>In finalising the Boards statement, members agreed that it was important to convey that the
						information received since the previous meeting had reinforced the need to remain vigilant to upside
						risks to inflation and that monetary policy will need to be sufficiently restrictive until members are
						confident that inflation is moving sustainably towards the target range. They also agreed that, based on
						the information available at the time of the meeting, it was unlikely that the cash rate target would be
						reduced in the short term, and that it was not possible to either rule in or rule out future changes in
						the cash rate target. Members will rely upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks to guide the
						Boards decisions. Returning inflation to target remains the Boards highest priority and it
						will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome.</p>
					<h2>The decision</h2>
					<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate target unchanged at 4.35 per cent, and the interest
						rate on Exchange Settlement balances unchanged at 4.25 per cent.</p>
