					<h1 class="page-title">Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board</h1>

										<p><strong>Hybrid – 17 and 18 June 2024</strong></p>
					<h2>Members participating</h2>

					<h2>International economic conditions</h2>
					<p>Members began their discussion of international economic developments by noting that recent data had
						confirmed that output growth in most advanced economies had troughed and that upside risks might be
						crystallising in some regions. Forecasters had revised up their expectations for growth in advanced
						economies for the current year, reflecting stronger-than-expected data for the March quarter amid
						improving global business sentiment. Nonetheless, restrictive monetary policy was still weighing on
						demand in most advanced economies and conditions in labour markets were also easing, although generally
						they remained tight.</p>
					<p>Members observed that inflation was still above central bank targets in most economies, and services price
						inflation had generally been stronger than expected since the start of the year. However, in some
						economies where output gaps were clearly negative, such as Canada and Sweden, services price inflation
						had continued to moderate.</p>
					<p>Indicators of activity for the Chinese economy had softened a little following strong growth in the March
						quarter, but the staffs outlook for growth in 2024 had not changed. Chinas external demand
						remained strong and was being supported by the nascent recovery in activity in advanced economies.
						Members observed that the recent announcement of new US and EU tariffs on some Chinese imports was
						further evidence of the increasing risk of broader trade tensions.</p>
					<h2>Domestic economic conditions</h2>
					<p>Turning to the domestic economy, members discussed the national accounts data for the March quarter. They
						noted the staffs assessment that aggregate demand had continued to exceed aggregate supply but that
						the gap was closing. Growth in GDP had been weak, reflecting subdued activity in the more interest
						rate-sensitive parts of the economy, such as retail spending and housing construction. Relative to
						expectations, growth in overall household and public consumption in the March quarter had been stronger
						than expected while other components had surprised on the downside. Members considered the implications
						for future growth of developments in these components.</p>
					<p>The level of consumer spending over the preceding 18 months had been revised upwards. Much of the
						upside surprise had been driven by large revisions to overseas travel, which were recorded as imports and
						so did not alter the measure of overall GDP. Estimates of household income had been little changed,
						implying downward revisions to estimates of the saving rate. These revisions had brought consumption
						growth more into line with the usual historical relationships with household income and wealth. Members
						assessed the signal to take from these revisions. One interpretation was that, on average, households
						were not being as cautious in their spending as previously thought. Another was that the fall in the
						saving rate would leave households even more financially squeezed than previously assessed. Members
						agreed that distinguishing between these alternative hypotheses was important in assessing the outlook
						for activity and inflation. But any conclusion could only be tentative, given that estimates of savings
						are prone to significant revision. Further, the latest estimates portrayed a different picture than that
						derived from data on mortgage-holders offset accounts, which showed that households were making
						larger extra payments than prior to the pandemic.</p>
					<p>Since the previous meeting, a number of Australian governments had released their budgets for <span class="no-wrap">2024/25</span>. Energy rebates and rent assistance would lower headline inflation in
						2024, though this direct effect would be reversed later in 2025. Members noted that the staff would
						incorporate an assessment of the impact of the budgets on the outlook for output and inflation in the
						August forecasting round.</p>
					<p>The labour market was still assessed as tight relative to full employment, though conditions had continued
						to ease gradually in recent months as expected. The easing in the labour market since late 2022 had
						occurred through an increase in the unemployment rate, a decline in average hours worked and fewer job
						vacancies. Employment growth had slowed over this period to be around the pace of growth in the
						working-age population. Recent employment growth had been supported by growth in industries where public
						funding was important.</p>
					<p>Members noted that wages growth had likely passed its peak for the current cycle. The easing in wages
						growth over the year to the March quarter had been broadly based, but outcomes in public and private
						enterprise bargaining agreements had been a little below expectations. Nonetheless, it was too early to
						determine if this signalled a more rapid easing in aggregate wages growth than currently expected. The
						Fair Work Commissions decision on award wages, which had been largely in line with expectations,
						would see award-linked wages growth step down this year. The implication of wages growth for inflation
						depended on its effect on unit labour costs, growth in which had moderated recently but remained high.
					</p>
					<p>Members discussed recent information from the RBAs liaison program. Firms were continuing to report
						upward pressure on costs, stemming from a range of sources. At the same time, firms in consumer-facing
						industries were reporting that it was becoming more difficult to raise prices, resulting in a narrowing
						of margins. Members noted that businesses appeared to be more focused on improving efficiency than they
						had been for some time, but obtaining internal approval for investments to automate processes was
						sometimes difficult as firms continued to look for ways to manage cashflow. They also noted the data
						showing a sharp increase in business insolvencies, although the share of firms entering bankruptcy
						remained in line with its historical average.</p>
					<p>Inflation remained above the target range and had been a little higher than expected in prior months. The
						monthly CPI indicator for April had exceeded expectations because of stronger-than-expected durable goods
						price inflation. However, there had been limited information about market services price inflation since
						the May meeting. Members acknowledged that these (limited) inflation data had increased the risk that
						sustainable progress towards the inflation target may be slower than forecast.</p>
					<p>Members judged that longer term inflation expectations in Australia were still anchored but should
						continue to be monitored closely. Several measures of inflation expectations had drifted up in recent
						years to be around the midpoint of the target band, after having been below target during the
						low-inflation period prior to the pandemic. Part of the increase in market-implied measures of inflation
						compensation over preceding years appeared to reflect larger premia to compensate for the risk that
						inflation turned out to be higher than expected. Members acknowledged that if inflation expectations were
						to rise materially from current levels, it could require significantly higher interest rates to bring
						inflation back to target, with adverse implications for growth in output and employment.</p>
					<h2>Financial conditions</h2>
					<p>Market participants expectations for the path of central bank policy rates in advanced economies
						were little changed since the May meeting, after increasing steadily in the first few months of the year.
						Market participants implied expectation continued to be that policy rates for most major central
						banks were around their peak, with cuts priced in over the second half of 2024. As expected, the Bank of
						Canada, the European Central Bank and Sveriges Riksbank had reduced their policy rates in response to
						weaker-than-expected indicators of economic activity, the emergence of spare capacity and progress on
						disinflation. However, these central banks had stated that they judged their monetary policy settings
						still to be restrictive and may need to remain so for some time. Other advanced economy central banks
						were waiting for more evidence that inflation would return to target sustainably. In particular, the US
						Federal Reserve had highlighted the persistence of inflation, resilient economic activity and ongoing
						labour market tightness.</p>
					<p>Sovereign bond yields in most advanced economies had declined a little since the May meeting. But yields
						were still higher than at the start of the year and when central banks had commenced raising policy
						rates. At the same time, some measures of global financial conditions had eased since late 2023. A range
						of risk asset prices, including equity prices, had risen further. Corporate bond yields had also risen by
						less than government bond yields since the start of the year, and conditions in international wholesale
						funding markets remained favourable. Members noted the volatility in European financial markets that had
						occurred following the European parliamentary elections.</p>
					<p>In China, credit growth had moderated, particularly for the household sector, against the backdrop of
						ongoing stress for property developers. The authorities had implemented new measures to address weakness
						in the property sector, including by providing funding to allow state-owned enterprises to purchase
						unsold homes from developers. Members noted assessments that these measures would provide helpful support
						to the property market but were not sufficiently large to affect prospects for the sector materially.</p>
					<p>For Australia, members concluded that overall financial conditions were restrictive, based on a range of
						measures. This was most notable for households and less so for large businesses.</p>
					<p>Required household debt payments had risen further. The rise in these payments had put pressure on the
						budgets of debtors and had contributed to the weakness in consumption growth. Despite the drag on income
						from cost-of-living pressures and higher required debt payments, extra mortgage payments were now a
						little above their pre-pandemic average. This is consistent with the incentive for debtors to reduce
						their net debts where possible when interest rates are high. Members acknowledged, alternatively, that
						this could reflect concerns about the economic outlook. By contrast, the (gross) saving rate had declined
						to be around 2½ percentage points below its pre-pandemic average, following substantial revisions to
						consumption in the March quarter national accounts. Members discussed how the fall in the measured saving
						rate and the rise in extra mortgage payments might be reconciled.</p>
					<p>Household credit growth was somewhat below average but had picked up a little in 2024. After accounting
						for the extra payments into offset accounts, housing credit growth had been further below average and had
						not picked up. Moreover, household credit outstanding had been declining as a share of household
						disposable income. By contrast, business credit growth had remained a little above its post-global
						financial crisis average and larger firms had continued to raise significant funds from bond markets this
						year, despite materially higher interest rates.</p>
					<p>Market pricing implied that markets were not expecting a near-term change in the cash rate, having earlier
						priced in some prospect of an increase. A rate cut was now not fully priced in until March 2025. The
						median expectation of market economists was also for the first reduction in the cash rate to occur in
						March 2025, about three months later than expected at the time of the previous meeting. Further ahead,
						market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to converge to a similar level to the policy rates
						in many other advanced economies in coming years. The expectation by market participants of later and
						fewer cuts than in other advanced economies might have reflected their assessment that the cash rate was
						closer to estimates of the neutral rate, in large part because the cash rate had not been increased to
						the same extent in Australia.</p>
					<p>The Australian dollar had appreciated slightly since the May meeting and, on a trade-weighted basis, was
						near the top of the range observed since early 2022.</p>
					<h2>Considerations for monetary policy</h2>
					<p>Turning to considerations for the policy decision, members noted that there had been several pieces of
						information since the May meeting that indicated a need to remain alert to upside risks to inflation.</p>
					<p>There had been further evidence that global growth had troughed in late 2023 and was gradually picking up,
						while disinflation had slowed in several countries. In Australia, inflation had also been higher than
						expected in April. And the revisions to historical estimates of consumer spending meant that consumption
						growth, while still weak, had been more resilient than previously assessed.</p>
					<p>Against this, members noted that GDP growth in Australia in the March quarter had been very weak and
						slightly lower than had been expected. There had also been further evidence that wages growth had likely
						peaked in late 2023. The labour market was continuing to ease gradually, broadly in line with
						expectations.</p>
					<p>Members noted that, despite restrictive financial conditions overall in Australia, growth in business debt
						had been a little above its post-global financial crisis average and the equity risk premium was low. A
						few other central banks had moved to a less restrictive policy stance by reducing their policy rates,
						while others were waiting for more evidence that inflation would return to target sustainably before
						easing.</p>
					<p>Members discussed the evolution of some key judgements relative to those underpinning the staffs
						forecasts in May. They noted that, on one view, the revisions to historical estimates of consumption
						challenged the earlier judgement that consumer spending would pick up only modestly as aggregate real
						disposable income recovered. At the same time, it was possible to interpret the revisions as implying
						that households were under more financial pressure than previously assessed, given the decline in the
						saving rate. Members noted that the August forecast round would provide an opportunity for the staff to
						carefully review the extent of spare capacity in the labour market and the economy more broadly. They
						observed that judgements about measures of spare capacity were very uncertain and should be treated with
						caution when setting policy. And while monetary policy was restrictive, an important judgement was
						whether policy settings were sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to target within the timeframe
						implicit in the Boards strategy.</p>
					<p>Given these observations, members considered their decision on the cash rate.</p>
					<p>Raising the cash rate at this meeting could be appropriate if members formed the view that policy settings
						were not sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe. This could
						be the case if it was judged that inflation was returning to target more slowly than previously assumed
						or that the gap between aggregate demand and aggregate supply was not closing quickly enough.</p>
					<p>Members noted that several pieces of new information could imply that demand was likely to hold up better
						than expected. The staffs forecasts from May had incorporated significantly more weakness in
						consumption than implied by historical relationships with the forecasts for income and wealth; the
						revisions to the consumption profile had brought these variables into closer alignment over the prior
						18 months. A gradual strengthening of the global economic cycle would also support demand in
						Australia. And financial conditions for businesses appeared to have eased a little over preceding months
						for some larger businesses. Collectively, these developments could limit the extent to which current
						policy settings were sufficient to bring aggregate demand back into line with aggregate supply. Moreover,
						recent inflation data – both domestically and from abroad – suggested some upside risk to the
						May forecast profile, since inflation was taking longer to abate than had previously been assumed.
						Members observed that the forecasts of several other central banks could be interpreted as implying that
						some spare capacity was necessary to bring inflation back to target within a reasonable timeframe, but
						that this was not the approach that had been adopted by the Board.</p>
					<p>The case to raise the cash rate could be further strengthened if members judged that aggregate supply was
						likely to be more constrained than had been assumed. Members noted that productivity growth remained very
						weak. And while inflation expectations were judged to be consistent with the inflation target, the
						increase in the market-implied risk premium suggested a higher risk of an increase in inflation
						expectations more widely.</p>
					<p>By contrast, the case to hold the cash rate steady at this meeting was based on the view that the economy
						was still broadly tracking on a path consistent with returning inflation to target in 2026, while
						preserving as many of the gains in employment as possible. Inflation had fallen significantly from its
						peak in late 2022, inflation expectations were assessed to be consistent with the Boards target and
						there was evidence that the pace of wages growth had peaked in late 2023. Output growth had continued to
						be weak and the output gap was closing. Members also acknowledged that it might be wise to give little
						weight to the signal for inflation from some pieces of information received since the May meeting. In
						particular, there were several reasons not to place too much weight on the revisions to consumption,
						including that much of the upside surprise had been related to imports, and it was extremely difficult to
						assess spare capacity accurately in real time.</p>
					<p>The case to hold the cash rate steady at this meeting would also be strengthened to the extent that risks
						to the outlook for the labour market were seen to be to the downside. Members observed that the fall in
						vacancy rates, for example, could be taken as an indication that labour market conditions were already
						weaker than implied by trends in employment. Moreover, the unemployment rate could rise quickly once it
						did start to rise, as had occurred in the past. Members acknowledged that, while the current rate of
						business failures as a share of all businesses was not unusual, a continuation of the rapid rise in
						insolvencies over coming months would have adverse implications for labour demand.</p>
					<p>In weighing up these options, members judged that the case to leave the cash rate unchanged at this
						meeting was the stronger one. Members agreed that the collective data received since the May meeting had
						not been sufficient to change their assessment that inflation would return to target by 2026, despite
						some elevated upside risk around the forecast. In addition, members judged that there had not been enough
						evidence that the outlook for aggregate demand had strengthened, noting uncertainty around the data for
						consumption and clear evidence that many households were experiencing financial stress. Members also
						affirmed their assessment that it was still possible to achieve the Boards strategy of returning
						inflation to target in a reasonable timeframe without moving away significantly from full employment,
						even though this narrow path was becoming narrower. With economic uncertainty heightened at
						present, members emphasised the importance of paying close attention to developments in the economic
						data.</p>
					<p>In finalising the Boards statement, members agreed that it was important to convey that the
						information received since the previous meeting had reinforced the need to be vigilant to upside risks to
						inflation, and that the extent of uncertainty at present meant it was difficult either to rule in or rule
						out future changes in the cash rate target. The Board will continue to pay close attention to
						developments in the global economy, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the
						labour market. Returning inflation to target remains the Boards highest priority and it will do
						what is necessary to achieve that outcome.</p>
					<h2>The decision</h2>
					<p>The Board decided to leave the cash rate target unchanged at 4.35 per cent, and the interest
						rate on Exchange Settlement balances unchanged at 4.25 per cent.</p>
